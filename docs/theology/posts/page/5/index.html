               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p><i class=editorial>On Sundays, I will be using this space as an opportunity to reflect publicly on the sermon presented.</i></p>
<p>Today, Ashok Nachnani<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> preached through 1 Corinthians 6:12&#8211;7:7. Since Paul speaks throughout this section (even across a topic change) about issues related to sexual (im)morality, Ashok, tackled the whole passage together.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> He broke the text down into three major points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flee sexual immorality.</li>
<li>Embrace marriage as a protection against sexual immorality.</li>
<li>Recognize that both marriage and singleness/celibacy are gifts from God.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ashok spent the greatest amount of time addressing the first issue&#8212;and he did an excellent job of it. Sexual immorality is a hot-button topic in our culture, and it is easy to talk too much, too harshly, too little, or too passively about it; I think Ashok hit the right balance of preaching both the sinfulness of sexual immorality and the glorious power of God&#8217;s grace in Christ. That is precisely the balance that we must <em>always</em> strive for, whatever the topic, and all the more so in areas where our culture is particularly sensitive.</p>
<p>A few gems that particularly stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual immorality is like a terrible house guest who promises to come for a short, pleasant visit&#8212;and instead sticks around indefinitely, destroying everything along the way.</li>
<li>Following Matt Chandler: &#8220;It is okay not to be okay. It is not okay to stay that way.&#8221; The gospel, Ashok reminded us, is for people who are <em>not okay</em>, and we need to welcome people however broken they are. At the same time, the gospel calls us to be transformed&#8212;not to remain in that same state of brokenness forever without change.</li>
<li>Ashok pointed out that the world tells teens that God made a beautiful garden, and promptly fenced off the nicest part with barbed wire, intimating that extramarital sex is worth violating God&#8217;s will. This is, he pointed out, not exactly a new lie&#8230; just a repetion of the <em>oldest</em> lie.</li>
<li>All of us face temptation in the area of sexuality&#8212;whether heterosexual or homosexual. As such, Christians who do not experience same-sex attraction can (at least to some extent) and <em>need to</em> empathize much more with the struggles of their brothers and sisters who <em>do</em> experience same-sex attraction. We must not treat homosexual practice as any worse than any other kind of extramarital sexual practice, but recognize instead that all of us are tempted and fallible in precisely this area, though not in precisely the same ways. For all of us, the call is to place our identity not in our sexuality but in Christ himself&#8212;a hard call, but one we are empowered to walk out by the Holy Spirit.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Marriage has many good purposes, including procreation, imaging Christ to the world, and sanctifying us&#8212;but Paul makes it clear that, among those many other purposes, it also helps us avoid sexual immorality. That was no less significant a help to the Corinthians than it is to us.</li>
<li>Marital sex is not about <em>using</em> your spouse for your own satisfaction, but about <em>giving</em> yourself to your spouse for his/her good pleasure.</li>
<li>When considering the gifts of marriage and singleness (and here Ashok was speaking particularly to singles), do not forget who the gift-giver is. He gives <em>no</em> gift out of spite, or ignorance of what is best for us; the gift of singleness is therefore a <em>good</em> thing, however it may feel at the time.</li>
<li>Trust God to give you all you <em>need</em>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>It is always tempting, when dealing with hard sin issues, to either gloss over them or to spend the entire time hammering on that issue. What believers (and non-believers!) need, though, is to hear both the deadly cost of sin, and the price that has already been paid for it. I was blessed today, because Ashok showed us the cost of sexual immorality <em>and</em> showed us the beautiful work of Christ in atoning for any and all our sexual immorality. Hallelujah.</p>
<hr />
<p><i class=editorial>I am also translating the sermon passage from Greek whenever applicable sometime Saturday or Sunday morning for my own profit; I will supply these translations, with some brief commentary, at the end of my reflections in case anyone is curious and wants to see my progress.</i></p>
<p>My translation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  All is permissible to me, but all is not helpful to me; all is permissible to me but I will not be mastered by anything. &#8220;Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food,&#8221; but God will do away with both. But the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. Now God both raised the Lord and will raise us by his own power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? So then, a member of Christ cannot become a member of a prosititute, can he? By no means! Or do you not know that the one who is united with a prostitue is one flesh with her? For it says, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221; But the one who is united with the Lord is one spirit with him. Flee sexual immorality! Every sin which a person does is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price&#8212;so then glorify God in your bodies!</p>
<p>  Now concerning that which you wrote, &#8220;It is good for a man not to touch a woman&#8221;&#8212; On account of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. The husband is to give what he owes to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but  her husband does; and likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does. Do not hold back from each other&#8212;unless by mutual consent for a time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again&#8212;that Satan may not tempt you by your lack of self-control. And I say this as a concession, not as a command&#8212;now I wish all men to be even as I myself am, but each one his  own gift from God: one of this sort, and another of that.
</p></blockquote>
<p>ESV(2007):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.” But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.</p>
<p>  Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p>
<p>  Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.
</p></blockquote>
<p>NIV(2011):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything. You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.” But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.</p>
<p>  Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.</p>
<p>  Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. I say this as a concession, not as a command. I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As with <a href="../../../surrendering-everything-to-win-something/index.html" title="Surrender Everything to Win Something—1 Corinthians 9:19–23">last week&#8217;s section</a>, the translations overlap substantially. For the most part, the language&#8212;both the vocabulary and the syntax&#8212;in 1 Corinthians is fairly straightforward. To wit: I was able to translate this passage while only having to look up about five words, and with little to no confusion on the grammar. Even granting that it is a familiar passage, this is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Between the NIV and the ESV, I <em>slightly</em> prefer the ESV&#8217;s rendering; the NIV (somewhat unusually) adds a <em>lot</em> of interpretive material throughout the text in this case. While the NIV aims for a smoother reading, for the most part it doesn&#8217;t add nearly as much interpretation as it does here. The editors are trying to make the consensus interpretation of the otherwise somewhat confusing text apparent: Paul is apparently quoting the Corinthians and then responding to their ideas or questions, so the NIV adds, &#8220;You say&#8230;&#8221; throughout. This is a somewhat reasonable attempt to bring across the <em>semantics</em> of the text, but it&#8217;s not a choice I&#8217;m particularly comfortable with, because it adds a great deal that simply isn&#8217;t present in the original. To be sure, moves like this are inevitable; the question is simply a matter of extent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the translators of the ESV made a few odd choices of its own. First, the way they chose to word the conclusion of the first paragraph (&#8220;Now as a concession, not a command, I say this&#8221;) is neither very good English nor even representative of the word order in the original Greek. (My translation represents the word order much more accurately.) In cases like this, the traditional&#8212;i.e. the King James Version&#8212;reading is usually to blame for odd wordings in modern English, but here the KJV <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%207:6&amp;version=KJV" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.biblegateway.com']);" title="1 Corinthians 7:6">worded it</a> much more like we would. In short, I have <em>no idea</em> why the editors of the ESV made that move. Second, unlike my translation or the NIV, they chose to supply &#8220;it is written&#8221; before introducing the quote from Genesis&#8212;but for a translation that proclaims its aim as using, as often as possible, the same words in English for the same words in Greek, this is strange. The word is <em>not</em> &#8220;written,&#8221; but &#8220;said&#8221;; in this case, the NIV is <em>more</em> literal than the ESV.</p>
<p>Again, on the whole I prefer the ESV&#8217;s rendering here, but only by a hair. The NIV removes a lot of ambiguity that makes the passage more confusing, but it does so by adding in a great deal of extra material. This is the balance every translation has to juggle constantly, and again, we see that each does better in some areas than in others.</p>

<h2>Thinking Through Matthew 10 Again</h2>
<p>As I told <a href="http://jaimiedawn.blogspot.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://jaimiedawn.blogspot.com']);" title="I'm hoping if I link to her blog she'll post again!">Jaimie</a> tonight, I have long found Matthew 10:31 to be one of those verses that is simultaneously comforting and a little funny. There is simply something a touch odd about the way it comes through in English:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (ESV)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in translations which generally prioritize a smoother reading (rather than the more literalistic approach favored by e.g. the ESV, NASB, etc.), end up with a phrase that is just, well, a little funny to read:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. (NIV2011)
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I worked through the surrounding chapter more carefully, though, the verse came home in a way that it never had before (even if I still think, and probably will always think, that it reads a little funny in English).</p>
<p>In Matthew 10, Jesus sends out his twelve disciples<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to do the same kinds of work he had been doing: casting out demons, healing people of their diseases, cleansing lepers, and even raising people from the dead. The comments that follow were his commission statements to his disciples. These are, notably, not exactly the cheeriest commissioning statements one might think to offer: they include not only the strong implication that the disciples <em>would</em> be rejected, but the promise of persecution even from within one&#8217;s own family and an incredibly heightened sense of the cost of discipleship. Following Jesus and taking his name to the nations is not child&#8217;s play, but hard and costly work.</p>
<p>And it is in this context that we find the somewhat amusing quote cited above&#8212;specifically, as Jesus warns his disciples <em>not</em> to act out of fear of man. The context makes the sentence much more serious: Jesus has just said that they should not fear men, who can kill only the body, but should instead fear God, who can destroy both body and soul in hell. He <em>follows</em> the statement with the promise that he will acknowledge before the Father those who acknowledge him before men&#8230; and <em>deny</em> before the Father those who deny him before men. The word about the sparrows, then&#8212;the promise that God cares about even the sparrows, and so much more for his children&#8212;is an enormously comforting thought when situated as it is in its context of prophesied persecution and hardship for those who follow Christ.</p>
<p>I am worth more than many sparrows. Hallelujah: I can proclaim Christ without fear of man.</p>
<h2>Genealogies Are Fun, Right?</h2>
<p>I also read Genesis 10 today. This is one of those lists of names that we generally find boring and pointless. However, if we affirm the divine inspiration of Scripture&#8212;that is, if we really believe that the Holy Spirit superintended the composition of these books so that we have everything we need, and we need everything we have&#8212;then there is a reason that there are lists of names in the Bible. I can think of several immediately: First, they are important in many cultures, even if not our own, as markers of historicity and authenticity. Second, they serve as markers for the reality that God is and always has been aware of the minutiae of even our genealogies. Third, and perhaps most significantly, they are part of the framework by which God communicates his ongoing work in history, culminating in the lists of names that come early in both Matthew&#8217;s and Luke&#8217;s gospel accounts. These are not mere random lists of names; they are part of the way God made sure that everyone could see that <em>he kept his promise</em>.</p>
<p>Tonight, I noticed one more of the tiny little pieces of Scripture that goes along with that. At the end of Genesis 10, Moses makes a neat little literary move that I had never caught before: he introduces the word &#8220;nations&#8221; into the narrative for the first time. Now, that might be mildly interesting if I didn&#8217;t know where things were going&#8212;but I do. I know that in just a matter of a few chapters, God will promise explicitly to make a <em>nation</em> that blesses all the families of the earth through Abraham. Just chapters after that, he will use the same word to promise that all the <em>nations</em> of the earth will be blessed through Abraham&#8217;s seed. This idea grows ever more prominent throughout the Old Testament: God will use Israel to bless the nations. It flowers into full fruition in the coming of Christ and his commission to his disciples: to preach the gospel to all the <em>nations</em>. Again: God keeps his promises, and even the dry little details like genealogies fit into the big picture of his glorious redemptive work in history, culminating in Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Adam, the son of God.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Jesus, upon finishing the Sermon on the Mount, came down from the mountain and immediately continued setting the world on its head. &#8220;Do not think that I came to abolish [the Law or the Prophets],&#8221; he said; &#8220;I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them&#8221; (Matthew 5:17). The statement <a href="../../../four-books-five-passages-one-messiah/index.html#fn:3" >seems a bit mysterious at the time</a>, but suddenly it becomes a bit clearer, because the things Jesus does when he comes down from the mountain are, well&#8230; surprising, and not always in line with the Law and the Prophets as the people understood them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, he not only heals a leper, but does so by <em>touching</em> said leper. Jesus immediately became ceremonially unclean.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> He then instructs the leper to fulfill the rest of the Mosaic Law&#8212;after having forfeited his own cleanness for that man&#8217;s sake in a way that ran directly contrary to the understanding of his peers about the intent of that Law.</p>
<p>The next narrative section is just as surprising&#8212;or it should be, if we were not so inured to it by familiarity. A centurion in the Roman army&#8212;the occupiers and oppressors of Israel&#8212;comes to him and asks him to heal his servant. Jesus makes the first surprising move simply by acquiescing to the request: &#8220;I will come and heal him,&#8221; he says (v. 7). And then things become truly surprising. First, the centurion rejects Jesus&#8217; offer to come, arguing that Jesus need only speak and whatever he says will be done&#8212;to which Jesus replies that he has not seen any such measure of faith among Israel, and promptly heals the man&#8217;s servant. <em>Then</em> he tells everyone that people from all over the world will come sit at God&#8217;s table while the &#8220;sons of the kingdom&#8221; (the biological heirs of the promise to Abraham) will be kicked out.</p>
<p>So now in the span of a few verses, Jesus has touched a leper, proclaimed a Gentile superior in his faith to anyone he had encountered in all Israel, and then announced that the fulfillment of the Messianic promises of the nations coming into Israel would coincide not with Israel&#8217;s exaltation but her disgrace. Coming to Matthew after reading the Old Testament, these announcements prompt mingled affirmation and confusion&#8212;affirmation, because yes, these are the things God promised; but confusion, because the way they are coming is not <em>exactly</em> what one would expect.</p>
<p>Jesus heals more people of sickness and demons. Then he calms a storm (to which his disciples, traveling with him, can say only, &#8220;What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?&#8221;&#8212;immediately after pleading for him to save them; see Matthew 8:25&#8211;27). That one took me aback a little bit, in at least two ways: (1) These men who had been following Jesus around watching him perform miracles, even to the point that they thought he might be able to do <em>something</em> while they were threatened by the weather, were astounded by what he actually did.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (2) He calmed a storm. Jesus spoke, and the storm calmed and the waves went away. <em>He was God.</em> Not just a powerful prophet, not just a man used of God, but God himself, and it showed. The point comes home again when he casts out yet more demons and sends them into a herd of pigs&#8212;he has the authority to do that!</p>
<p>Sometimes slowing down and thinking about the books, especially in their settings in the Bible as a whole, helps me see things more clearly. In this case, it makes it much more obvious why the people found Jesus so confusing: he doesn&#8217;t do anything the &#8220;right&#8221; way, and he was always doing things that took people&#8217;s breath away, because he was <em>God</em> and man. More&#8212;much more&#8212;than they expected in their Messiah. Someone not only to follow to the worship of God in the new age, but God himself, to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

It is also striking that he rebukes his closest followers for their little faith immediately after commending a Gentile for his great faith.

               <p><i class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>I find Genesis 6&#8211;8 to be some of the most challenging passages in all of Scripture. The account of Noah and his family and many animals boarding a boat and surviving a worldwide flood by the mercy of God is an amazing picture of both God&#8217;s wrath against sin and his mercy to those who call on him. I do not find the passage difficult for theological reasons, so much (though I understand why others wrestle with the section there), but for the difficulty they present in reconciling the Scriptures with the evidence of the world around us.</p>
<p>I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics and I spend a substantial part of my time outside of seminary working as a software developer. Science is deep in my soul; the way the universe ticks has always fascinated me and the way we study the universe no less so. The combination of these pieces leaves me able to understand&#8212;far better than many of my peers&#8212;just how odd the narrative seems scientifically.</p>
<p>There are plenty of parts of the history that do not trouble me at all. That God <em>could</em> miraculously flood the entire earth is not a matter of doubt in the least. That he could miraculously carry people and animals through the flood is likewise unproblematic for me. Even the repopulation of the earth with animals from what was an impossibly small sample<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> when compared to the nearly incomprehensible biodiversity that characterizes our world is as nothing for the one who made all things.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> God made the universe; he is perfectly capable of managing a worldwide flood without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The problem, from my point of view, is that&#8212;all the arguments to the contrary of Ken Ham and his fellow travelers notwithstanding&#8212;there is not a shred of credible evidence for a worldwide flood in the geological record. It is an item that must be taken purely on faith, and not only on faith but on faith that runs exactly contrary to all the best evidence otherwise available to us. For a faith that sets as its capstone the historicity of a miracle, this is troublesome.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Granting that scientific evidence is always open to revision, the best we have right now says, &#8220;This didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221; That leaves me in a strange spot.</p>
<p>The spot is strange precisely <em>because</em> ours is a historical faith, and because I am confident&#8212;absolutely confident&#8212;that 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ really did rise from the dead, and he really is enthroned at the right hand of God the Father in heaven right now,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and he really is coming back to set all things to rights. I believe his word, and I believe that the Scriptures are true. The historical evidence is amazing; the testimony from the internal coherence of Scripture itself is remarkable; and I and many others have personally witnessed the power of God in the lives of believers and unbelievers alike&#8212;to heal people, to deliver from demons, and to radically transform people from those who <em>hate</em> God to those who <em>love</em> him. I <em>believe</em> and <em>trust</em> in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And I have <em>no</em> idea what to do with Genesis 6&#8211;8 other than to continue asking questions in a posture of faith seeking understanding.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> I believe the passage, because it is the word of God, though I do not understand it yet. But&#8212;for now&#8212;that is enough. Jesus does not require that we understand every last thing, and he does not demand that we set aside all our questions; he requires only that we believingly obey him even as we continue asking in faith that he will ultimately answer us (and more, that he will ultimately satisfy us more than the answers will). And so as I continue seeking how best to understand this passage, I will also continue worshipping my risen, reigning God-Man Savior-King.</p>

Obligatory tweaking of the nose of all angrily ardent anti-evolutionists: If we assume that all animals alive today are descendants of animals that were on that boat, and think about the size of the boat and the number of distinct species of animals on the planet&#8212;including every kind of bird, reptile, and mammal&#8212;we are forced inevitably to the conclusion that God directed massive, species-boundary-crossing evolutionary diversification in the immediate aftermath of the flood, or otherwise to suppose that he simply recreated all the other species (in which case, why bother taking that particular set on the boat?).

               <p><i class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Matthew 6 includes one of the more provocative statements and approaches to personal holiness anywhere in the Bible. Coming out of the &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8230;&#8221; section in chapter 5, chapter 6 transitions to a series of statements that include, &#8220;&#8230;they have their reward. But you&#8230;&#8221; The whole sequence hammers home the cost of public practice of holiness for the eyes of men. The cost, it turns out, is that one gets exactly what one was seeking&#8211;but that turns out not to be much of a prize at all.</p>
<p>The adulation of men, in the final reckoning, is a short-lived thing that satisfies no one. Our hearts were made for something deeper, truer, and richer than the admiration of other people: we were made to be satisfied by God&#8217;s delight in us and our delight in him. When we please <em>God</em>, we have grounds for real joy. When we simply earn the admiring looks of other men by performing all our good deeds to be noticed&#8230; well, we have our reward. We get the attention we want from people, but miss all the real joy in those good deeds&#8211;deeds God intended to proceed from our love for him, and which, when they come instead from a desire to be loved by people, become just one more form of idolatry.</p>
<p>And idolatry, it must be said, is a very great part of what got us all into this mess in the first place. So to the man who embraces his man-pleasing ways, and especially to the man who uses &#8220;holiness&#8221; and good works as a means to earning the favor of other people, God says, &#8220;Okay. You got your prize. But that is all there is for you so long as you are pursuing the affections and attentions of other people over and above me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t satisfy.</p>
<p>All the more striking is the placement of the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s prayer&#8221; here, right in the middle of this section. Matthew seems intent on hammering home that no part of our spiritua life&#8211;prayer included&#8211;is excluded from Jesus&#8217; critique. The prayer he offers is simple, to the point, and without the flourishes that too often characterize my own ways of approaching God. More, this prayer is to be offered in private, in the closet, where only God hears. Who else actually needs to hear our prayers? Can anyone else answer them? Can anyone else do <em>anything</em> about them&#8211;except find us worthy of admiration?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is particularly hard-hitting for me, because I have sometimes wondered, &#8220;Did others agree with what I prayed?&#8221; when, during times of corporate prayer there was little verbal affirmation of my own prayers. (I have wondered such things the <em>most</em> when there was verbal affirmation of others&#8217; prayers but not of mine. Ever &#8220;Amen&#8221; suddenly seemed a mark for or against me, depending on who was praying when it came out.) Yet, plainly put, that is simply this same idolatry: wanting my prayer to be affirmed by the people around me. I ought instead strive to please God in the way I pray, and rest confident that he hears and responds.</p>
<p>Conviction. Hallelujah.</p>

This is of course not an argument against corporate prayer. It is, instead, an argument against prayer for <em>attention</em>, which can happen in many ways and many places, including corporate prayer&#8230; but one could, in fact, very easily make a big deal out of going in the closet for long periods of prayer, simply to earn the admiration of other believers. <em>You already have your prize.</em>&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><i class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p><i class='editorial'>On Sundays, I will be using this space as an opportunity to reflect publicly on the sermon presented.</i></p>
<p>Over this summer, our regular teaching pastor, Andy Davis, is on sabbatical, working on a number of writing and ministry projects. As such, the other pastors have been rotating through<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and working through 1 Corinthians. Today, Ron Halbrooks taught through 1 Corinthians 9:19&#8211;23, in which Paul famously traces out the ways he surrendered his own rights for the sake of the gospel and encourages the Corinthians to imitate his example. Ron focused on three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Paul made himself a slave to all. Paul&#8217;s surrender of his own rights was one of the means by which he advanced the gospel: he made sure there was nothing &#8211; really nothing! &#8211; of his own preferences that he would not give up for the sake of people&#8217;s believing in Christ. Though he refused to compromise when people wanted to add requirements to the gospel, he refused to let any non-essential get in the way of his ministry. Ron exhorted us to follow Paul&#8217;s example, and especially to consider the preferences we struggle to overcome in reaching out to those who do not yet follow Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cultural setting: Paul was sensitive to the particular areas in which he needed to make changes. There were plenty of things neither Jews nor Gentiles cared about, and areas where one group was fixated on things the other was not. As Paul went about his ministry, he paid attention to these differences and adapted accordingly. When he was with the Jews, he carefully followed the law; when he was with Gentiles, he had no such concern (how would they have known one way or the other?). Ron pointed out that we need to do the same: do we need to overcome language gaps or be thoughtful of the kinds of food people like? Can we set aside preferences we hold strongly that are merely cultural in order to win others to Christ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save <em>some</em>. The goal of Paul&#8217;s ministry was to save some. He did not make these sacrifices just because he could (who would want that?), and he did not take the salvation of souls lightly. He aimed to bring about people&#8217;s <em>salvation</em>, not merely to educate or inform the world. As such, there was an urgency and an intensity about his actions we would do well to imitate. Because Paul&#8217;s goal was not mere education or even cultural change, but eternal salvation, he was moved to take significant or even drastic measures in pursuit of that goal. We, too, ought to consider the goal sufficiently significant as to motivate us so deeply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ron concluded by exhorting the congregation to take a number of practical steps forward in response to Paul&#8217;s example. First, he challenged the congregation to intensify its efforts in sending members out on mission to the world, whether as international missionaries or as domestic church planters. Second, he exhorted us all to intentionally reach out to those in our community who are unlike us &#8211; whether internationals with whom we do not share even language, or simply people from a different cultural background (e.g. white folks having black folks over for dinner and vice versa).</p>
<hr />
<p><i class='editorial'>I am also translating the sermon passage from Greek whenever applicable sometime Saturday or Sunday morning for my own profit; I will supply these translations, with some brief commentary, at the end of my reflections in case anyone is curious and wants to see my progress.</i></p>
<h2>1 Corinthians 9:19&#8211;23</h2>
<h3>Chris Krycho&#8217;s translation</h3>
<blockquote><p>
  For, though being myself free from all, I made myself a slave to all, in order that I might gain many. And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those under the law as under the law (though not myself being under the law), that I might gain those under the law; to those outside the law as one outside the law (though not myself being outside the law with respect to God, but rather subject to Christ) that I might gain those outside the law; I became weak to those who are weak, that I might gain the weak; I have become all things to all people that by all means I might save some. And I do all for the sake of the gospel, so that I might become a participant in it.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>ESV</h3>
<blockquote><p>
  For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>NIV(2011)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h3>
<blockquote><p>
  Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You will note that the translations overlap quite substantially. Both the ESV and NIV add periods and fill in the phrase &#8220;I became&#8221; where I used semicolons and left the phrase out in most cases. My translation is more &#8220;literal,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not more <em>accurate</em>. The sentence I wrote is better Greek than English; that sort of &#8220;piling on&#8221; of phrases was <em>good</em> form for them, but it&#8217;s what we call a run-on sentence in English. Even with semicolons, it&#8217;s just not the best way of putting it; if I were to go back and smooth this out I&#8217;d add those in just as the ESV and NIV have.</p>
<p>You can see, though, that this is a pretty straightforward passage, and not particularly contentious. The ESV and NIV, though they have somewhat different translation philosophies, ended up with <em>very</em> similar results here, and even my own rough, first-pass translation came fairly close to their carefully studied work. Some passages are like this &#8211; they make for a nice change of pace from those which are difficult or ambiguous.</p>
<p>The final sentence is most interesting: I&#8217;ve left it rough on purpose, but it&#8217;s clear that something is sort of missing in my translation. Both the NIV and the ESV supply &#8220;blessings&#8221; and translate the sentence accordingly, with some variations as to the syntax. This is interesting, because it&#8217;s being <em>inferred</em> from the text. I&#8217;m quite curious about why they&#8217;re inferring this, as the UBS<sup>4</sup> Greek New Testament simply doesn&#8217;t have a word for &#8220;blessing&#8221; present. I&#8217;ll probably go look this up in a commentary somewhere to see, because I&#8217;m curious.</p>

I think this is <em>great</em>. Given a choice, I would advocate strongly for much more frequently pulpit rotation, and for that matter against the idea of a &#8220;senior pastor&#8221; at all. As I often say in these short devotional pieces: more some other time.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

Yes, I know the SBC passed a resolution arguing against the NIV2011. While I have concerns with certain interpretive moves the NIV2011 made, I have nearly identical concerns (albeit in different places and different directions) with some of the translations the ESV has made &#8211; and the same with the HCSB, the NASB, the NKJV, and so on. No translation is perfect, and the NIV2011 is in general a <em>very</em> good translation.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
