               <p><i class=editorial>I am making an ongoing discipline out of writing up reflections on my devotions&#8212;hopefully a majority of the days each week. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Joseph is an interesting character. I have heard many a sermon on him, ranging from critiques of the way his pride got him in trouble to hagiographies that hold him up as an example to follow (not to mention a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ). What is most interesting to me at the moment, however, is that the text makes little moral commentary on Joseph at all. From his introduction in Genesis 37 until his death at the end of the book, Moses gives us very few direct comments on Joseph&#8217;s character.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is much that is admirable about the way Joseph carries himself throughout this whole sequence, especially as we come in a few chapters to his behavior when Potiphar&#8217;s wife makes a pass at him. As for his dream-telling at the beginning, I am inclined to let that pass (not least because my wife often tells me <em>her</em> dreams, no matter how crazy they get.) For all that Joseph is a good model for us in many ways, though, and even for all that he <em>does</em> prefigure Christ,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the central figure of the narrative is not Joseph, but Yahweh.</p>
<p>First, this is precisely the point Joseph makes to his brothers when they meet again in Egypt decades later: what they meant for evil, God had meant for good. Joseph was a player in that story, as were his more-and-less wicked brothers, but ultimately it was Yahweh, providentially orchestrating <em>all</em> things, who was responsible for all that came about. And from a literary perspective, this is also the only way to make sense out of the aside in chapter 38 to Judah&#8217;s wretched affair with Tamar in Genesis 38: otherwise, why the sudden turn from Joseph to Judah? Yes, there is a contrast between the righteous brother and the wicked brother, but why is this contrast necessary? We already know Judah is a troublemaker: he was the one who suggested selling Joseph into slavery in the first place! No, there is more going on here.</p>
<p>At least <em>part</em> of that &#8220;more&#8221; is that it is not the righteous brother that God will use to bring about ultimate salvation, but the wicked one. The kingship went not to Reuben, the firstborn; nor to Joseph, the most favored of Jacob&#8217;s sons; but to Judah, the malcontent&#8212;and that via his illicit affair with his daughter-in-law as she played the prostitute! God&#8217;s plan of salvation does not hinge on righteous men (though he certainly does use such men to bring about good for his people throughout history). His plan of salvation is in the end all about demonstrating that he can use even wicked men to bring about his purposes, and that he is interested in saving even those wicked men. Jesus, it is true, is the new and better Joseph&#8212;but he came through Judah.</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>In Part I, I argue that God does not indicate his will to us by means of subjective feelings, and survey the Old Testament record of God&#8217;s interactions with his people.

<hr />
<h3>The Will of God in the New Testament</h3>
<p>The same patterns established in the Old Testament appear again in the New Testament, though much more broadly applied as of the coming of the Spirit in Acts. Zachariah, Mary, and Joseph all experience angelic visitations with clear messages from God in plain language. John the Baptizer<sup id="fnref:ii-2"><a href="#fn:ii-2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> preached a God-given message of the coming Messiah in a way that seems to be analogous to the prophecy of the Old Testament prophets. Paul experienced a vision of the risen Lord, who spoke to him directly, and other visions which were explained to him or otherwise had clear meanings. John experienced a revelation which was also explained to him. Many believers in the New Testament were given words from the Lord, and these, too, seem to have been unambiguous and followed the pattern of the prophets of old. The one New Testament prophecy we have directly recorded, in Acts 21, marks someone giving a clear and unambiguous warning to Paul. Above all, Jesus himself came and declared to his followers all the wisdom of God, fulfilling the role of prophet perfectly.</p>
<p>Again, what about the ambiguous or mysterious aspects of New Testament prophetic revelation? In terms of mystery, the Bible does not explain to us the mechanics of the New Testament prophetic gift any more than it does that in the Old Testament. Dreams and visions, when they appear, are explained or understood automatically. Perhaps most ambiguous are two passages in Acts. In Acts 16, Paul and his company were &#8220;forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.&#8221; What this means is unclear, for this is all the text says.</p>
<p>The other passage worth further consideration occurs in Acts 15, when the Jerusalem council wrote to the Gentile churches about the relationship between Gentiles and Jewish law. In verse 28, their letter includes the phrase, &#8220;It has seemed good to the Spirit and to us&#8230;&#8221; As we read this in the larger context, its meaning becomes clear. The letter has already stated simply &#8220;it seemed good to us&#8221; (15:25). Luke&#8217;s records that &#8220;it seemed good to the apostles and elders, with the whole church&#8230;&#8221; to send out messengers with this letter. He records that James&#8217; position carried the day, a position James explained by saying, &#8220;Therefore, my judgment is&#8230;&#8221; This passage is arguably the strongest justification for the evangelical view today, but I actually think it argues the <em>other</em> way. There is no reference to any &#8220;sense&#8221; or &#8220;feeling&#8221; in sight. Rather, they simply listened to what was going on, considered the scriptures, and made a decision that seemed best to them as a group. In other words, the church simply trusted that the Holy Spirit was leading them together into wisdom.</p>
<p>At no time, then, does the New Testament suggest that these interactions between God and man manifested in the form of subjective &#8220;senses,&#8221; especially a sense of &#8220;peace&#8221; or strong inner urgings. At best one could argue that this <em>might</em> have been the case in some of the ambiguous instances outlined above. Without any other proof, though, that is a very shaky position, especially given the clear evidence of how God <em>did</em> speak in the New Testament.</p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>Through all of this, one common thread should have become apparent. When God speaks, it is always&#8212;without exception!&#8212;clear that he has spoken. His leading is always unmistakable and unambiguous (save for the dreams, but someone always has a clear interpretation). Given that we do not endorse several means that <em>were</em> practiced in the Scriptures, I am at a loss as to why we make decisions by means that are <em>never</em> mentioned in the Bible. If we are going to allow Scripture to set the norms by which we relate to God, we must admit that we have no reason to believe that our internal &#8220;sense&#8221; about things is in any way a message from God. (That does not, by the way, make emotions useless or meaningless; they are in actuality a very useful part of decision-making. They simply are not the voice of God!)</p>
<h4>Aside: &#8220;I just have a peace about it&#8221;</h4>
<p>I find it fascinating that two of the most misused Scriptures in the New Testament come almost side by side, both from the book of Philippians. Along with the much-abused &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&#8221; (4:13) we have Paul&#8217;s note that &#8220;the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus&#8221; (4:7). This is not, however it has been applied, a promise that he will give you a &#8220;peace&#8221; about the right decision, but a promise that supernatural peace will comfort the believer who prays instead of embracing anxieties and fears. Moreover, this peace is the right of all believers who are walking with Christ&#8212;not just those who are making the correct decisions at any given moment. Paul prays this peace for all his churches!</p>
