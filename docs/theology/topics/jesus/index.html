               <p><i class=editorial>I am making an ongoing discipline out of writing up reflections on my devotions&#8212;hopefully a majority of the days each week. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Tonight I came to the end of the book of Genesis. (I would have done so <em>last</em> week, had I not gotten sick. Alas.) The last four chapters of the book range from the proasic details of Joseph&#8217;s dealings with the Pharaoh and the Egyptian people to the poetic content of Jacob&#8217;s blessings for his sons. As far as conclusions go, the book <em>ends</em>, but there is not exactly a sense of denouement: Jacob dies, and then Joseph dies; this part of the story is at an end, but there are so very many promises unfulfilled. Indeed, the ending is something of a cliff-hanger for the attentive reader, who will have in the back of his or her head Yahweh&#8217;s promises to Abraham&#8212;both that his offspring would inherit Canaan and that first they would be slaves in a different nation. There are other promises, too: of the &#8220;offspring&#8221; (or &#8220;seed&#8221;) of the woman who will crush the serpent&#8217;s head, of future kingship in Judah&#8217;s line, of blessings not only to Abraham&#8217;s family but also to the nations.</p>
<p>There are a few passages that highlight the God at work throughout the book as this first section of the Torah comes to a close. Jacob, blessing Joseph&#8217;s sons, speaks of Yahweh: &#8220;The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, / the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day, / the angel who has redeemed me from all evil&#8230;&#8221; Jacob began his journey speaking of God wholly as his father&#8217;s God, surprised to find him still present far from his family&#8217;s worship. He ended his journey aware that the God of his fathers had watched over him from Canaan to Padan Aram and back again, and then on the trek down into Egypt. Yahweh was no longer only his father&#8217;s and grandfather&#8217;s God, but <em>his</em> God.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, of course, one cannot&#8212;or at least, <em>ought</em> not!&#8212;pass over these chapters without stopping to read Jacob&#8217;s blessing on Judah very carefully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judah is a lion&#8217;s cub;<br />
  from the prey, my son, you have gone up.<br />
  He stooped down; he crouched as a lion<br />
  and as a lioness; who dares rouse him?<br />
  The scepter shall not depart from Judah,<br />
  nor the ruler&#8217;s staff from between his feet,<br />
  until tribute comes to him;<br />
  and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.<br />
  Binding his foal to the vine<br />
  and his donkey&#8217;s colt to the choice vine,<br />
  he has washed his garments in wine<br />
  and his vesture in the blood of grapes.<br />
  His eyes are darker than wine,<br />
  and his teeth whiter than milk.<br />
  (Genesis 49:9&#8211;12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This language is evocative in its own right, but how it grows in power as one considers the rest of the Scriptures! The glimpses of fulfillment that come in David and Solomon&#8212;too quickly shattered by their fallenness and foibles, and then wrecked almost entirely in the kings that followed in their wake&#8212;only make the longing for the real king that much stronger. And right here is the font of so much imagery throughout the rest of the scriptures, both of messianic hope and fearful judgment. It is hard to read of garments washed in wine and in the blood of grapes without thinking of sin staining Christ on our behalf and the pure white garments he has given us instead.</p>
<p>If Genesis ends with the conclusion unwritten, bidding us look forward into Exodus to see what will come next, this particular prophecy <em>still</em> bids us look forward to see what will come next. Jesus has filled it up with meaning, and the Revelation gives us a glimpse of how he will fill it up finally&#8212;but that ultimate reality of &#8220;the obedience of the peoples&#8221; awaits our proclamation of the gospel to the ends of the earth and his coming again to reign in glory. Genesis looks forward; and so do we.</p>
<p><em>Maranatha</em>. Lord, come soon.</p>

I believe this is also this very first time that the image of God-as-shepherd appears in the Bible. The way the Pentateuch in general and Genesis specifically establishes the baseline for the rest of the Scriptures is nothing short of amazing: this kind of internal unity and consistency is hard to come by from a <em>single</em> author&#8212;still less the dozens who authored the Bible.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><i class=editorial>In Part I, I argue that God does not indicate his will to us by means of subjective feelings, and survey the Old Testament record of God&#8217;s interactions with his people.

<hr />
<h2>How <em>do</em> we decide, then?</h2>
<p>There is one, and only one, passage in the New Testament that explicitly tells us how we will learn to discern the will of God:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I exhort you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God: present your bodies as a sacrifice&#8212;living, holy, acceptable to God&#8212;as your reasonable worship and do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of the mind, so that you may be able to discern what is will of God: what is good, acceptable, and perfect. (Romans 12:1&#8211;2, my translation)
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I have argued in <a href="../../as-sacrifices-living-holy-pleasing-to-god/index.html" >my exegesis</a> of this text, Paul tells us here that the way we grow to know the will of God is by pursuing the transformation of our mind as we grow in holiness. This is harder work than learning to lean on our subjective senses of things, certainly, and it really does not offer us the kind of assurance about day-to-day decisions that so many of us are looking for. It fits with the rest of Scripture&#8217;s witness, though, and (as I will argue in a moment) is ultimately a liberating reality.</p>
<p>There are a number of other passages which confirm that the Christian way of making decisions is simpler than we have made it. On the one hand, we have the many examples outlined above. Most notably, the Jerusalem council simply reasoned from the Scriptures and made a decision&#8212;and this about an incredibly important decision for the health of the whole church. In his epistle, James rebuked his audience for presuming that their days were theirs to plan, but his counsel was not to look for a sense from God about their course of action. Instead, he enjoined them to simply make their plans <em>humbly</em>: &#8220;Instead you ought to say, &#8216;If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that&#8217;&#8221; (James 4:15). Similarly, Paul would write of his own plans that he would visit the church at Rome if it was God&#8217;s will (Romans 1:15, 15:32).</p>
<p>From this completed picture, we learn a basic pattern for discerning the will of God. First, bow to what he reveals unambiguously. For us, this is both first and finally the Scriptures, where God has declared clearly what he wants us all to know, culminating in the person and work of Jesus Christ. We thus know that God&#8217;s will for us is above all to know him and Jesus Christ, whom he sent into the world. <em>This</em> is what the Holy Spirit is doing above all: sanctifying us and bringing us into the knowledge of God. All his gifts to the body are given so that people will know and worship Jesus Christ the Risen Lord.</p>
<p>Second, if God should speak clearly and unambiguously to us, we should listen! I know one person who has claimed to hear God speaking directly to her about circumstances in her life&#8212;and as long as the things this person hears accord with Scripture, I would be far more inclined to grant that validity than any subjective sense, because it does accord with how God acted in the Bible! Any such revelation&#8212;whether an audible voice, a prophecy given in the church, or a dream or vision which has meaning clearly understood&#8212;must be judged against the final authority of Scripture. I would also suggest that, from my survey of Scripture, God usually speaks in that way not simply for the ordinary circumstances of our lives, but when he is accomplishing something specific to salvation history. To bring that down to earth: I think it far more likely that God would speak in that way for direction to the <em>church</em> than for direction to <em>individuals</em> (though I do not rule it out for the latter).</p>
<p>Third as we pursue holiness and live in close community with other believers, we will be able to come to wise decisions about the courses of action we ought to take. If the church at Jerusalem could come to a decision about a complex issue with massive implications for the future of the church in this way, we can make decisions in our own lives this way!</p>
<p>All of this highlights a reality that I find increasingly liberating. God does not mean for us to discover his plan for our lives and <em>then</em> live it out, but rather to discover it <em>by</em> living it out. It is not that he does not care about our jobs, or our families, or our homes, or any of a myriad other decisions we make day to day. Rather, it is first of all that he cares far more that we know and delight in him, and secondly that he is providentially orchestrating <em>all</em> those things to bring us closer to him.</p>
<p>As a result, I do not have to worry day by day whether I am doing the &#8220;right&#8221; thing. Most of the decisions in my life are morally neutral, and nearly all of the rest are obviously spelled out in Scripture. (For the remaining few, we have ethics classes at the seminary to think through incredibly complex and difficult issues for a reason.) For all those morally neutral decisions, Jaimie and I ask together, &#8220;What seems good to us? What will allow us to most effectively glorify God?&#8221; We pray for wisdom. We seek counsel from our friends and family, especially those who are believers. We invite input from our pastors and others with whom we are in fellowship at our church. If God spoke to us audibly, or clearly in a dream, we would listen! Above all, we continually seek to &#8220;be transformed by the renewing of [our] minds&#8221; as Paul enjoins us in Romans, pursuing holiness.</p>
<p>In the end, we make the decision that seems best to us. The bigger the decision, the more time we will spend on all of those steps&#8212;but at no point do we worry about &#8220;having a peace&#8221; about the decision or look for a subjective sense of what to do. We trust that God is good, and in his providence works <em>all</em> things to good, and recognize that he has not revealed his will for our lives to us, but allows us the chance to grow in wisdom and make good decisions. This is incredibly freeing. More importantly, it is in accord with Scripture.</p>

<h3>The Will of God in the New Testament</h3>
<p>The same patterns established in the Old Testament appear again in the New Testament, though much more broadly applied as of the coming of the Spirit in Acts. Zachariah, Mary, and Joseph all experience angelic visitations with clear messages from God in plain language. John the Baptizer<sup id="fnref:ii-2"><a href="#fn:ii-2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> preached a God-given message of the coming Messiah in a way that seems to be analogous to the prophecy of the Old Testament prophets. Paul experienced a vision of the risen Lord, who spoke to him directly, and other visions which were explained to him or otherwise had clear meanings. John experienced a revelation which was also explained to him. Many believers in the New Testament were given words from the Lord, and these, too, seem to have been unambiguous and followed the pattern of the prophets of old. The one New Testament prophecy we have directly recorded, in Acts 21, marks someone giving a clear and unambiguous warning to Paul. Above all, Jesus himself came and declared to his followers all the wisdom of God, fulfilling the role of prophet perfectly.</p>
<p>Again, what about the ambiguous or mysterious aspects of New Testament prophetic revelation? In terms of mystery, the Bible does not explain to us the mechanics of the New Testament prophetic gift any more than it does that in the Old Testament. Dreams and visions, when they appear, are explained or understood automatically. Perhaps most ambiguous are two passages in Acts. In Acts 16, Paul and his company were &#8220;forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.&#8221; What this means is unclear, for this is all the text says.</p>
<p>The other passage worth further consideration occurs in Acts 15, when the Jerusalem council wrote to the Gentile churches about the relationship between Gentiles and Jewish law. In verse 28, their letter includes the phrase, &#8220;It has seemed good to the Spirit and to us&#8230;&#8221; As we read this in the larger context, its meaning becomes clear. The letter has already stated simply &#8220;it seemed good to us&#8221; (15:25). Luke&#8217;s records that &#8220;it seemed good to the apostles and elders, with the whole church&#8230;&#8221; to send out messengers with this letter. He records that James&#8217; position carried the day, a position James explained by saying, &#8220;Therefore, my judgment is&#8230;&#8221; This passage is arguably the strongest justification for the evangelical view today, but I actually think it argues the <em>other</em> way. There is no reference to any &#8220;sense&#8221; or &#8220;feeling&#8221; in sight. Rather, they simply listened to what was going on, considered the scriptures, and made a decision that seemed best to them as a group. In other words, the church simply trusted that the Holy Spirit was leading them together into wisdom.</p>
<p>At no time, then, does the New Testament suggest that these interactions between God and man manifested in the form of subjective &#8220;senses,&#8221; especially a sense of &#8220;peace&#8221; or strong inner urgings. At best one could argue that this <em>might</em> have been the case in some of the ambiguous instances outlined above. Without any other proof, though, that is a very shaky position, especially given the clear evidence of how God <em>did</em> speak in the New Testament.</p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>Through all of this, one common thread should have become apparent. When God speaks, it is always&#8212;without exception!&#8212;clear that he has spoken. His leading is always unmistakable and unambiguous (save for the dreams, but someone always has a clear interpretation). Given that we do not endorse several means that <em>were</em> practiced in the Scriptures, I am at a loss as to why we make decisions by means that are <em>never</em> mentioned in the Bible. If we are going to allow Scripture to set the norms by which we relate to God, we must admit that we have no reason to believe that our internal &#8220;sense&#8221; about things is in any way a message from God. (That does not, by the way, make emotions useless or meaningless; they are in actuality a very useful part of decision-making. They simply are not the voice of God!)</p>
<h4>Aside: &#8220;I just have a peace about it&#8221;</h4>
<p>I find it fascinating that two of the most misused Scriptures in the New Testament come almost side by side, both from the book of Philippians. Along with the much-abused &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&#8221; (4:13) we have Paul&#8217;s note that &#8220;the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus&#8221; (4:7). This is not, however it has been applied, a promise that he will give you a &#8220;peace&#8221; about the right decision, but a promise that supernatural peace will comfort the believer who prays instead of embracing anxieties and fears. Moreover, this peace is the right of all believers who are walking with Christ&#8212;not just those who are making the correct decisions at any given moment. Paul prays this peace for all his churches!</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>As Matthew comes to the close of his narrative, things start to heat up. Coming to chapter 23, Jesus engages with the Pharisees and scribes in terms we would be hard-pressed to describe as gentle or forbearing. &#8220;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!&#8221; he belts out over and over again, calling them on the floor for their folly.</p>
<p>This passage is challenging on a number of levels, but I think it most profoundly runs up against our culture of hyper-tolerance. It is hard for most of us nice Christian types to imagine ever speaking this way&#8212;to ever be so harsh or judgmental as to call anyone out like this, to be so blunt and so bold and so <em>mean</em>. To be sure, there are some unique circumstances in play here, circumstances in which we do not exactly find ourselves. We are never the son of God confronting those who have rejected his messianic ministry, never in perfect knowledge of the hearts of those with whom we interact, never completely sinless in our anger. It is <em>right</em> for our response to be tempered toward grace and charity in our interactions with others.</p>
<p>Even so, I wonder if perhaps we have not taken on something of the character of the milquetoast. It is an easy direction to slide, given the timbre of our public discourse these days. With few exceptions, and the rancorous quality of much political debate notwithstanding, it is increasingly rare for anyone (but especially Christians) to be bold in confronting sin without being immediately accused of being judgmental jerks.</p>
<p>I am all for grace, and seeking to understand one another&#8217;s positions well before we offer critique, and representing one another&#8217;s positions well when we do offer critique. I am sensitive to my own tendency to assign motive where I ought not, to my own inability to judge clearly and rightly, and to the ease with which I fall into pushiness. But I worry that if building a culture where this kind of stern rebuke is unacceptable (again, with those very few exceptions), we are doing great harm to ourselves. Without diminishing the call to grace, or making any less of precisely the qualifications I outlined above, I think the church needs to grow in boldness in confronting in our own midst both blatant hypocrisy and doctrines that keep people from coming to Christ.</p>
<p>One of these is easy: if there is a single exception to our unflagging devotion to tolerance, it is in our hatred of hypocrisy. The other, however, too often gets a free pass. People who hinder others from coming to Christ because of their additions to or subtractions from the gospel are dangerous and, after being confronted graciously and gently, should be confronted harshly and shown up to be the false teachers that they are. The aim is not to <em>win</em>; it is to preserve the people of God from being deceived. To do this well is hard; the &#8220;watchblogger&#8221; cohort&#8212;the &#8220;heresy hunters&#8221; who appoint themselves this task&#8212;are almost by definition <em>not</em> up to the challenge of discerning what response is appropriate in any  situation.</p>
<p>When the people of God are at risk, however, we must learn to be bold. Jesus was. Paul was. Peter was. James was. Perhaps it is time we follow their example instead of bowing to the whims of culture.</p>

<h2>He Saw Yahweh</h2>
<p>In Genesis 18, Abraham has just finished following God&#8217;s instructions about circumcision. At 100 years old, he circumcised himself, along with his 13-year-old son and all his servants and the other members of his household, to obey this God who had called him from his homeland to a place where he would always be a sojourner, looking forward with hope to the homeland God had promised but which he himself would not inherit. (There is real obedience for you: embrace circumcision so that someone <em>else</em> will get the reward God promises&#8230;)</p>
<p>Then, sitting in the shade one hot afternoon, Abraham looks and sees Yahweh,<sup id="fnref:G-1"><a href="#fn:G-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> standing there as a man he recognizes. At that point, this 100-year-old man (who, granted, lived to be 160 and therefore was probably like a man in his mid to late 50s physically) got up and <em>ran</em> to prepare a feast for his God. There are many interesting things in this passage, but most notable to me tonight was the way Yahweh came to Abraham and interacted with him throughout the passage. That is: he came as a man<sup id="fnref:G-2"><a href="#fn:G-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and ate with Abraham and spoke with him. Of course, he spoke prophetically about impossibilities that he was going to bring about; this condescension was not his ceasing to be God but his taking on a form so that Abraham could know him.</p>
<p>So here we have at once two concrete realities that continue to shape the reader&#8217;s expectations for what God will do in the future: the promise of a miraculous son born to bring about his promise, and Yahweh himself coming as a man to relate to his people.</p>
<h2>Over the Waters</h2>
<p>Coming after a series of prayerful Psalms, the 29th is a complete change in tone. Each of the Psalms preceding it are prayers for deliverance from evildoers and from Yahweh&#8217;s judgment on one&#8217;s own wickedness. Here, though, we have David calling on the heavenly host to ascribe to Yahweh all the glory he is due, and a crescendo of declarations of the power of Yahweh&#8217;s voice. This God of glory<sup id="fnref:P-1"><a href="#fn:P-1" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> is over all, his voice thundering and shaking even the greatest things on this earth. He is worthy for the heavenly host to ascribe him glory and strength, to be worshipped in the splendor of holiness. He is enthroned in his temple; he sits as king <em>forever</em>.</p>
<p>And this is the God who walked with Abraham, who let Abraham challenge him and his judgments. The Judge of all the earth, whose powerful and majestic voice can cause an earthquake or strip the forest bare, has become <em>one of us</em>.</p>

This passage highlights one more reason why I prefer simply to use God&#8217;s self-revealed name: early on, Abraham calls him &#8220;lord,&#8221; but not &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>,&#8221; which is simply confusing if you&#8217;re not paying close attention.&#160;<a href="#fnref:G-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

This relatively innocuous phrase, right in the middle of verse 3, has been one of the most important in my life. Five years ago, reading through the Psalms much as I am right now, the phrase leapt out at me, because I had no idea what it meant to describe Yahweh as the &#8220;God of glory.&#8221; A month later, my whole theological framework had been turned on its head, from the anthropocentric view that unfortunately characterizes too much evangelical theology, to a radically God-centered view that accords with the Scriptural picture of a God who is working all things for his own sake, and not because of us at all&#8212;though how greatly we benefit!&#160;<a href="#fnref:P-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Jesus, upon finishing the Sermon on the Mount, came down from the mountain and immediately continued setting the world on its head. &#8220;Do not think that I came to abolish [the Law or the Prophets],&#8221; he said; &#8220;I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them&#8221; (Matthew 5:17). The statement <a href="../../four-books-five-passages-one-messiah/index.html#fn:3" >seems a bit mysterious at the time</a>, but suddenly it becomes a bit clearer, because the things Jesus does when he comes down from the mountain are, well&#8230; surprising, and not always in line with the Law and the Prophets as the people understood them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, he not only heals a leper, but does so by <em>touching</em> said leper. Jesus immediately became ceremonially unclean.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> He then instructs the leper to fulfill the rest of the Mosaic Law&#8212;after having forfeited his own cleanness for that man&#8217;s sake in a way that ran directly contrary to the understanding of his peers about the intent of that Law.</p>
<p>The next narrative section is just as surprising&#8212;or it should be, if we were not so inured to it by familiarity. A centurion in the Roman army&#8212;the occupiers and oppressors of Israel&#8212;comes to him and asks him to heal his servant. Jesus makes the first surprising move simply by acquiescing to the request: &#8220;I will come and heal him,&#8221; he says (v. 7). And then things become truly surprising. First, the centurion rejects Jesus&#8217; offer to come, arguing that Jesus need only speak and whatever he says will be done&#8212;to which Jesus replies that he has not seen any such measure of faith among Israel, and promptly heals the man&#8217;s servant. <em>Then</em> he tells everyone that people from all over the world will come sit at God&#8217;s table while the &#8220;sons of the kingdom&#8221; (the biological heirs of the promise to Abraham) will be kicked out.</p>
<p>So now in the span of a few verses, Jesus has touched a leper, proclaimed a Gentile superior in his faith to anyone he had encountered in all Israel, and then announced that the fulfillment of the Messianic promises of the nations coming into Israel would coincide not with Israel&#8217;s exaltation but her disgrace. Coming to Matthew after reading the Old Testament, these announcements prompt mingled affirmation and confusion&#8212;affirmation, because yes, these are the things God promised; but confusion, because the way they are coming is not <em>exactly</em> what one would expect.</p>
<p>Jesus heals more people of sickness and demons. Then he calms a storm (to which his disciples, traveling with him, can say only, &#8220;What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?&#8221;&#8212;immediately after pleading for him to save them; see Matthew 8:25&#8211;27). That one took me aback a little bit, in at least two ways: (1) These men who had been following Jesus around watching him perform miracles, even to the point that they thought he might be able to do <em>something</em> while they were threatened by the weather, were astounded by what he actually did.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (2) He calmed a storm. Jesus spoke, and the storm calmed and the waves went away. <em>He was God.</em> Not just a powerful prophet, not just a man used of God, but God himself, and it showed. The point comes home again when he casts out yet more demons and sends them into a herd of pigs&#8212;he has the authority to do that!</p>
<p>Sometimes slowing down and thinking about the books, especially in their settings in the Bible as a whole, helps me see things more clearly. In this case, it makes it much more obvious why the people found Jesus so confusing: he doesn&#8217;t do anything the &#8220;right&#8221; way, and he was always doing things that took people&#8217;s breath away, because he was <em>God</em> and man. More&#8212;much more&#8212;than they expected in their Messiah. Someone not only to follow to the worship of God in the new age, but God himself, to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

It strikes me that this is a major part of what Jesus does for us: he comes to us, and touches us, and becomes <em>unclean</em> that we might be healed of our infirmities.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

It is also striking that he rebukes his closest followers for their little faith immediately after commending a Gentile for his great faith.

<p><i class='editorial'>And yes, I missed yesterday&#8217;s post. I did that on purpose, because I decided that celebrating my fourth anniversary with my wife was <strong>much</strong> more important than writing a 500-word blog post. Perhaps because I missed that one, or perhaps because I&#8217;m simply in a verbose mood tonight, you&#8217;re getting more than the usual 500 words in the main text, and a <strong>lot</strong> more if you count the footnotes.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>One of the interesting things about tackling multiple sections of Scripture at the same time is seeing the ways they shine light on each other. If we affirm &#8211; as I do &#8211; that Scripture is inspired not only in its individual parts but as a whole book, as a <em>canon</em>, then putting the pieces together can make all of them make more sense.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Today, for example, I was reading in Genesis 4, Psalms 9 and 10, Proverbs 20, and Matthew 5. One would not necessarily expect these five (counting each of the Psalms as a distinct reading<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) disparate texts to particularly overlap in their content.</p>
<p>In a way, that expectation is not far wrong. Genesis 4 highlights Cain&#8217;s murder of Abel, his offspring&#8217;s worsening sin, and the birth of Seth and his son Enosh. The Psalms both focus on God&#8217;s righteousness and sovereign rule over the earth, though from different angles &#8211; in the first, David expresses thanksgiving for God&#8217;s judgment on evildoers; in the second, he offers a pained plea for God to judge wicked men who seem to get away with their sin. Proverbs, as is typical for The Proverbs of Solomon (chapters 10&#8211;24), is a mix without a particular focus. Matthew 5 contains the first part of Jesus&#8217; teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, including the beatitudes, his declaration that he has not come to abolish but to fulfill the law,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and his series of &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8230;&#8221; statements.</p>
<p>Genesis 4 hammers home that sin <em>escalates</em>. It is a matter of mere sentences from the time God removes Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden to the time their first son murders their second son in a fit of jealousy. It is only a few <em>more</em> sentences before one of Cain&#8217;s descendants is boasting about how he will kill a man over trivial offenses. Things start bad and get worse in a hurry. The end of the chapter &#8211; and the end of the section that started in chapter 2 &#8211; gives a little hope, though: when Adam and Eve have Seth, Eve declares that God has given her an &#8220;offspring,&#8221; a <em>seed</em>: the very word God used to promise the one who would crush the serpent&#8217;s head, and the word that becomes a touchstone throughout the rest of Scripture to point to the coming Messiah. <em>Then</em> people began to call on the name of Yahweh.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>David was the anointed king of Israel. He was the first fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to set the crown in the line of Judah, and that promise in turn was part of God&#8217;s Messianic promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In both of these Psalms, though, his focus is on the righteous reign of Yahweh as the hope of the oppressed against the wicked. In both the prayer of thanksgiving (Psalm 9) and the imprecatory prayer (Psalm 10), David ultimately returns to Yahweh&#8217;s eternal reign as the hope of the righteous over and against the predations of the wicked. Yet, as the second psalm makes clear, Yahweh does not <em>seem</em> to be reigning at the moment.</p>
<p>The Proverbs of Solomon <a href="../../learning-humility/index.html">rarely</a> dive directly into theology proper or what we might call &#8220;theological anthropology.&#8221; The focus is nearly always on enormously practical observations about life &#8211; the sorts of things that really are profitable to make us wise, but which do not directly tell us about the character of God or our relationship to him. They are, instead, focused on wisdom that God has given us to be able to live wisely in this world, broken as it is. In the middle of this set of Proverbs, however, are a pair of statements that caught my attention because they <em>are</em> more theologically elevated, as it were. Verse 9 reads, &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin&#8217;?&#8221; and verse 12 reads, &#8220;The hearing ear and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made them both.&#8221; Between the two the author suddenly and sharply reminds the reader that God made all things, and that no one is capable of making himself righteous or pure in heart &#8211; and so all are accountable before God who is creator and judge.</p>
<p>Finally, in Matthew Jesus takes the high bar of the righteousness demanded by the Law and the Prophets, and modeled by the Pharisees, and sets it incredibly higher. The final of his &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8221; sayings ends thus: &#8220;You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#8221; This is <em>impossibly</em> higher. The just and righteous God who made all things, who really is reigning and who does judge the wicked even if it does not always seem so, demands that we be <em>perfect</em>. But this same God promised a seed who would set things to right &#8211; a promise he was honoring and keeping, Matthew has made clear already, right down through Jesus.</p>
<p>When Jesus says he hasn&#8217;t come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them &#8211; when he continues by saying they won&#8217;t pass away until they are <em>completely</em> fulfilled &#8211; and then promptly makes it clear that no one is going to fulfill them <em>but</em> him, Proverbs 20:9 comes back to mind. &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin&#8217;?&#8221; No one &#8211; but Jesus. He made all things; he fulfilled the law; his heart was pure and clean; he is the seed; he is the one on whom people call for salvation; he judges the wicked and was judged for our wickedness; he is the final Davidic king who reigns forever; he is the one who is perfect as our Father is perfect and who has given us his perfection.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

This is one reason I&#8217;d like to see pastors preach through longer sections of more parts of the Bible much more frequently. But more on that in a non-devotional post, some other day. This post is going to be <em>long</em> even as it is.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
Worth note: the original text doesn&#8217;t have any heading between the two chapters, unlike many other breaks. As such, it is possible they should be viewed as connected, at least to some extent: the editor of the Psalms grouped and arranged them in a particular way for a reason. Again: more on that some other day.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
Which is flatly <em>shocking</em> if you actually step back and read the book as a book, rather than importing your assumptions about what Jesus is doing, and especially if you read it in its canonical context. Here we are, plowing into the Messianic narrative Matthew provides as the first book out of the Old Testament, and with absolutely no reason in the book &#8211; and certainly no clear reason to expect it from the Old Testament &#8211; Jesus suddenly announces that he&#8217;s <em>not</em> here to abolish the Law or the Prophets. We&#8217;ve become so inured to the changes the New Covenant brought that we rarely stop and consider this at all. &#8220;Why in the world,&#8221; we should all be asking, &#8220;would anyone think &#8211; at this point, at least &#8211; that he <em>was</em> going to abolish the Law or the Prophets?&#8221; And then he promptly goes and even further ups the ante&#8230; but more on that back in the non-footnote text.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
I use God&#8217;s self-revealed name because I do not see any warrant in Scripture to follow the Jewish custom of not speaking or writing it. When you see <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span> in the Old Testament and it&#8217;s in small caps (as it is there if you have a decent, modern web browser), that&#8217;s &#8220;Yahweh.&#8221;&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
