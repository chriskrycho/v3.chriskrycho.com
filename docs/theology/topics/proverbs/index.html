               <blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool,<br />
  but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered<br />
  &#8212;Proverbs 28:26</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time I hit the first of these two proverbs, it reminds me of the profound importance of submitting to the Word of God as our final standard. Combine it with the second, and a two-by-four to the head might be less clear. Tempting as it is at times to turn to our own wisdom, doing so is folly of the highest magnitude. The person who will not listen to God&#8217;s ways&#8212;the ways he has gone to great lengths to reveal to us&#8212;will not even be heard when he prays. This should lead Christians to shudder at the thought of willful disobedience to God&#8217;s word. Our own wisdom will lead us nowhere good. Wisdom is found only with God. This is a good encouragement to me to press on in this habit of daily devotional study.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have been reading and rereading Philippians as Jaimie and I start working on memorizing it together this week. I find that reading books as a whole makes their meaning much clearer to me,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and especially having a sense of the flow of the book is especially helpful for memorization. A number of points stood out to me as I worked through Philippians as a whole, instead of focusing on the few verses usually emphasized (whether by pastors or simply by my own interests and focuses in previous study).</p>
<p>First, Paul <em>really</em> delights to see the gospel advance. This is obvious, of course: he built his life around proclaiming the life, death, resurrection, and reign of Jesus the Jewish Messiah to the Gentiles. Still, nothing brings it home like his declaration that he is even happy to see the gospel proclaimed by others out of envy and rivalry (1:17)&#8212;just so long as the result is that &#8220;in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed&#8230;&#8221; (1:18) <em>That</em> is Paul&#8217;s final grounds for rejoicing. Likewise, Paul points out that his imprisonment has really served to advance the gospel, and therefore is a cause for joy. I&#8217;m not sure most of us&#8212;myself certainly included&#8212;would be equally happy under the circumstances. May I ever grow to be more like that!</p>
<p>Second, it is easy to simply skip over or fail to grasp the enormity of Paul&#8217;s Christ-hymn in chapter 2. We have heard it preached so often that it is easy to miss the depths in his exploration of how much Jesus humbled himself. The eternal second person of the Trinity, the divine Son, the everlasting Logos, put on mortal humanity and embraced mortality in the most agonizing, humiliating way possible. He was publicly shamed in death that he might put our shame to death.</p>
<p>When Paul enjoins the Philippians to continue in their obedience, and to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, it is on this basis. His argument: Christ has done these things, and so God exalted him&#8212;now you obey, for you God is working in you, giving you both the will and the ability to obey him.</p>
<p>Third, I was struck again by how central the resurrection was to the way Paul thought about his life, and about the Christian life in general. Paul embraced suffering&#8212;<em>great</em> suffering&#8212;and counted everything this life offers and all his former credentials as nothing, as rubbish<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Why? So that he might know Christ and the power of <em>his</em> resurrection and share in his sufferings. We might understand why Paul would want to know Jesus and the power of his resurrection, but why would he want to share in his sufferings? He answers: &#8220;so that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&#8221; He staked his whole life on the belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, and offered the same to any who would pick up their cross and follow him.</p>
<p>That let Paul have the perspective that all this life has to offer is as nothing compared to the surpassing value of knowing Jesus. It enabled him to keep in mind that we are not citizens of this world, but of heaven&#8212;the heaven from which our Savior will come again and &#8220;transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body&#8221; (3:21).</p>
<p>Finally, a brief note that deserves considerable expansion. In 3:18&#8211;19, Paul describes those who walk as &#8220;enemies of the cross&#8221;&#8212;people who are ruled by their desires, who glory in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things. From Paul we might expect biting anger towards such bad examples. Instead, Paul writes that he tells the Philippians of these men and women with <em>tears</em>. No doubt Paul was angered at times by those who led others astray; we see that clear enough at other places in his letters. But here, he is moved to sorrow that there are some who would lead others astray and are so led astray themselves. All of us would do well to see our lives more characterized by this kind of sorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cease to hear instruction, my son,<br />
  and you will stray from the words of knowledge.<br />
  &#8212;Proverbs 19:27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This admonition from Proverbs 19 seems to me to be at the heart of many young people&#8217;s struggles with their parents, their teachers, and their churches. By &#8220;young,&#8221; I mean &#8220;under the age of 30,&#8221; so I&#8217;m in that list, too, as are most of my closest friends. This is a perennial struggle, and the reason every generation ends up relearning the same lessons its parents  (or their parents; things tend to go in cycles) already learned. Simply put: young people (I include myself) are not particularly good at listening. It doesn&#8217;t matter how smart I am, how widely I read, or how well-educated I am; if I refuse to be instructed, I will wander away from truth.</p>
<p>I have, sadly, seen this born out in others&#8217; lives, and it was a chastening experience. I have seen smart young people who love God walk deeper and deeper into folly simply because they will not be corrected. There are few things more dangerous to our spiritual health, and therefore few things more foolish, than refusing to listen to the counsel of those who have gone before you. Age does not always equal wisdom, and experience does not always make one right&#8230; but they <em>do</em> give one a much better shot, especially when coupled with diligent pursuit of God and holiness. Perhaps my cohort ought to take James&#8217; admonition to heart: &#8220;let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>Matthew 24, as one of the central prophetic texts in the New Testament regarding Jesus&#8217; return, is of course hotly debated. Those debates, while interesting,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> can sometimes distract us from the point of the passage. Matthew spent a substantial part of his book on this section, and it comes at an interesting point in the narrative. Jesus&#8217; increasingly public embrace of his role as the Messiah has culminated with his smashing condemnation of the spiritually blind religious leaders of his day (in chapter 23), and this prophetic section (chapters 24&#8211;25) is folloewd immediately by the plot to kill Jesus, the Passover, and the Passion narrative. So why the sudden pause on prophecy? It seems almost a detour, but if we assume Matthew was a competent author who knew what he was doing, he had a reason for turning to the only extended prophetic section in the book.</p>
<p>First, this future-telling cements Jesus&#8217; role as prophet. Given the role that prophets played in Israel&#8217;s history and Matthew&#8217;s portrayal of Jesus as the fulfillment of each Jewish archetype (prophet, priest, and king), this makes sense. Moreover, the placement in the text makes sense here, as well: just as the prophets condemned religious blindness and empty ritual in their day <em>and</em> foretold God&#8217;s future works, here Jesus does exactly the same.</p>
<p>Second, this extended narrative provides a cap to Jesus&#8217; teaching in the book. He has covered ethics (especially in the Sermon on the Mount), outlined a theology of the coming kingdom (mostly through parables), and now explains in greater detail what the coming of that kingdom will be like. From here on out, the book turns almost entirely to pure narrative, with no more extended teaching sections. Jesus, Matthew shows us, cared about the state of his followers after his death, resurrection, and ascension. He gave them (us) an idea of what to expect&#8212;not the nitty gritty details we all might like,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but the big picture that we need. Jesus will come again, after his followers suffer trials and tribulations so fierce that many will be tempted to (and indeed many will) fall away. Believers must endure, and hold fast to their faith in him, and be ready. He will come when we could not predict, and he will come indeed.</p>
<p>A final thought: if <em>our</em> anticipation of Jesus&#8217; return&#8212;with its attendant end to wickedness and suffering and sorrow&#8212;is great, how much more so is his?</p>
<p>Lord, haste the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,<br />
  and by the fear of Yahweh one turns away from evil.<br />
  &#8212;Proverbs 16:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading through the Proverbs, one finds gem after gem. (Indeed, the whole book is a collection thereof. That&#8217;s the <em>point</em>, after all.) This one particularly caught my attention tonight, though: it is as pithy a statement of the gospel as one could wish. Simple, straightforward, easy to understand, and embedded with more canonical weight than you could shake a stick at. &#8220;Steadfast love and faithfulness&#8221; are <em>the</em> marks of God&#8217;s covenant love throughout the Old Testament; these keywords from <a href="../../the-pivotal-self-revelation-of-god-in-the-old-testament/index.html">Exodus 34</a> are perhaps those most cited by the authors of the Old Testament. By Yahweh&#8217;s character-defining work, the author<sup id="fnref:P-0"><a href="#fn:P-0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> says, comes salvation. Fearing him is how we turn away from evil. When the apostles preached the gospel in the New Testament, they may not have used <em>exactly</em> these words,<sup id="fnref:P-1"><a href="#fn:P-1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but this was their message: God acted in accord with his character and his covenant promises to bring salvation. Repent!</p>
<p>This one is going in my to-memorize list. It will be a good reminder for me as I go through my own life, and hopefully a helpful way of reminding others who God is and what he has done as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reading through Matthew and Genesis in parallel is often illuminating; I expect I shall find the same to be true of other books as I continue on this path. Coming to chapter 22 of each book, I found Jesus answering his Pharisee and Sadducee opponents in the temple, and God testing Abraham by instructing him to sacrifice Isaac. At first glance, the passages could not seem less related, apart from the overt covenant themes and pointers in the Genesis passage. However, a bit more time made one particular connection stand out to me.</p>
<p>When Jesus answers the Sadducees on the resurrection (after their contrived question about seven brothers having had one woman as their wife with no children), he rather pointedly tells them that the reason they are wrong is that they &#8220;know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.&#8221; Given the relative paucity of reference to resurrection from the dead in the Old Testament, his accusation is an interesting one (though of course he backs it up moments later by pointing to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;the God of the <em>living</em>, not the dead). One of the many places the Sadducees should have seen that God will bring about resurrection is right in Genesis 22. As the author of Hebrews points out, Abraham went up that mountain in faith that the same God who had given him a son&#8212;in his old age, from his barren wife&#8212;could raise that same son from the dead if necessary to keep his promise.</p>
<p>The Sadducees should have seen it coming; all the pieces were there. But they knew neither God&#8217;s word, nor God himself. Given these were men who had spent their lives studying the Scriptures, this is a fearful warning to those of us who seek to know those same Scriptures.</p>
<p>God provided another way&#8212;not the child sacrifice so common in that day and age, but a substitute.<sup id="fnref:GM-0"><a href="#fn:GM-0" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Ultimately, he provided his own son, and raised <em>him</em> from the dead after sacrificing him on a mount. That which he did not ultimately require of Abraham, he gave himself. But Abraham&#8217;s faith was well-placed: God could have raised Isaac from the dead, and someday he will do just that. Someday he will raise us, too. But first of all, he raised his son. Hallelujah.</p>

               <p>I continue to find Proverbs interesting, challenging, and insightful in ways I have not experienced in years. While I have made a habit of spending time in the book off and on since childhood (my parents encouraged me to read it regularly, not least for its advice on honoring and listening to one&#8217;s parents!), I have only begun to grasp how profoundly true its usually straightforward wisdom is as I have come back to it yet again in these last few weeks. God has seen fit to speak to almost any aspect of the mundane we could imagine or wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck,<br />
  will suddenly be broken beyond healing. (Proverbs 29:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with a number of verses I have come across in the last week, this one struck me in no small part because I now have had enough experience to see it for true experientially. Not personally, thanks be to God and to many faithful friends and family members who have born with me well. But I have watched others resist rebuke <em>ad nauseum</em>, and the result is never pleasant. Those who refuse to listen when others bring correction&#8212;who are absolutely unwilling to change&#8212;ultimately suffer for their stubborn folly. The choices we make are not without consequences; we can go on only so long before they catch up with us and <em>break</em> us. In light of this, we should learn to see God&#8217;s rebukes and his chastisements as measures of his grace. He does not rebuke us or bring chiding situations into our lives out of malice, but out of love, to save us from ourselves.</p>
<p>This has me doubly thoughtful: reminded, first of all, to be quick to accept rebuke in my own life, and then also to pray for those I know who are struggling in this area.</p>
<h2>Matthew 11</h2>
<p>It has been rather in vogue these last few years to suggest that what Jesus really cared about was the plight of the poor and downtrodden&#8212;what we might call issues of &#8220;social justice.&#8221; To be sure, Jesus <em>did</em> care about these things, and God has always cared about them. (There is hardly a book in the Bible where this concern is not displayed!) But as profound as God&#8217;s hatred of injustice and abuse of the helpless is, there is something he hates even more, unpopular as though is to say it: <em>unbelief</em>. In Matthew 11, Jesus rebukes three cities, Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Capernaum, not for any other sins but because there he had done a great many miracles, and they did not believe him. And refusing to believe in Christ deserved a harsher punishment than did all the myriad sins of Tyre and Sidon and Sodom: cities known for everything from economic injustice to rape and murder. We must therefore keep the gospel&#8217;s call to repent and believe Christ first and foremost&#8212;not neglecting the other matters of righteousness, but not forgetting that which is worst and has the highest penalty.</p>

<p><i class='editorial'>And yes, I missed yesterday&#8217;s post. I did that on purpose, because I decided that celebrating my fourth anniversary with my wife was <strong>much</strong> more important than writing a 500-word blog post. Perhaps because I missed that one, or perhaps because I&#8217;m simply in a verbose mood tonight, you&#8217;re getting more than the usual 500 words in the main text, and a <strong>lot</strong> more if you count the footnotes.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>One of the interesting things about tackling multiple sections of Scripture at the same time is seeing the ways they shine light on each other. If we affirm &#8211; as I do &#8211; that Scripture is inspired not only in its individual parts but as a whole book, as a <em>canon</em>, then putting the pieces together can make all of them make more sense.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Today, for example, I was reading in Genesis 4, Psalms 9 and 10, Proverbs 20, and Matthew 5. One would not necessarily expect these five (counting each of the Psalms as a distinct reading<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) disparate texts to particularly overlap in their content.</p>
<p>In a way, that expectation is not far wrong. Genesis 4 highlights Cain&#8217;s murder of Abel, his offspring&#8217;s worsening sin, and the birth of Seth and his son Enosh. The Psalms both focus on God&#8217;s righteousness and sovereign rule over the earth, though from different angles &#8211; in the first, David expresses thanksgiving for God&#8217;s judgment on evildoers; in the second, he offers a pained plea for God to judge wicked men who seem to get away with their sin. Proverbs, as is typical for The Proverbs of Solomon (chapters 10&#8211;24), is a mix without a particular focus. Matthew 5 contains the first part of Jesus&#8217; teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, including the beatitudes, his declaration that he has not come to abolish but to fulfill the law,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and his series of &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8230;&#8221; statements.</p>
<p>Genesis 4 hammers home that sin <em>escalates</em>. It is a matter of mere sentences from the time God removes Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden to the time their first son murders their second son in a fit of jealousy. It is only a few <em>more</em> sentences before one of Cain&#8217;s descendants is boasting about how he will kill a man over trivial offenses. Things start bad and get worse in a hurry. The end of the chapter &#8211; and the end of the section that started in chapter 2 &#8211; gives a little hope, though: when Adam and Eve have Seth, Eve declares that God has given her an &#8220;offspring,&#8221; a <em>seed</em>: the very word God used to promise the one who would crush the serpent&#8217;s head, and the word that becomes a touchstone throughout the rest of Scripture to point to the coming Messiah. <em>Then</em> people began to call on the name of Yahweh.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>David was the anointed king of Israel. He was the first fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to set the crown in the line of Judah, and that promise in turn was part of God&#8217;s Messianic promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In both of these Psalms, though, his focus is on the righteous reign of Yahweh as the hope of the oppressed against the wicked. In both the prayer of thanksgiving (Psalm 9) and the imprecatory prayer (Psalm 10), David ultimately returns to Yahweh&#8217;s eternal reign as the hope of the righteous over and against the predations of the wicked. Yet, as the second psalm makes clear, Yahweh does not <em>seem</em> to be reigning at the moment.</p>
<p>The Proverbs of Solomon <a href="../../learning-humility/index.html">rarely</a> dive directly into theology proper or what we might call &#8220;theological anthropology.&#8221; The focus is nearly always on enormously practical observations about life &#8211; the sorts of things that really are profitable to make us wise, but which do not directly tell us about the character of God or our relationship to him. They are, instead, focused on wisdom that God has given us to be able to live wisely in this world, broken as it is. In the middle of this set of Proverbs, however, are a pair of statements that caught my attention because they <em>are</em> more theologically elevated, as it were. Verse 9 reads, &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin&#8217;?&#8221; and verse 12 reads, &#8220;The hearing ear and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made them both.&#8221; Between the two the author suddenly and sharply reminds the reader that God made all things, and that no one is capable of making himself righteous or pure in heart &#8211; and so all are accountable before God who is creator and judge.</p>
<p>Finally, in Matthew Jesus takes the high bar of the righteousness demanded by the Law and the Prophets, and modeled by the Pharisees, and sets it incredibly higher. The final of his &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8221; sayings ends thus: &#8220;You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#8221; This is <em>impossibly</em> higher. The just and righteous God who made all things, who really is reigning and who does judge the wicked even if it does not always seem so, demands that we be <em>perfect</em>. But this same God promised a seed who would set things to right &#8211; a promise he was honoring and keeping, Matthew has made clear already, right down through Jesus.</p>
<p>When Jesus says he hasn&#8217;t come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them &#8211; when he continues by saying they won&#8217;t pass away until they are <em>completely</em> fulfilled &#8211; and then promptly makes it clear that no one is going to fulfill them <em>but</em> him, Proverbs 20:9 comes back to mind. &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin&#8217;?&#8221; No one &#8211; but Jesus. He made all things; he fulfilled the law; his heart was pure and clean; he is the seed; he is the one on whom people call for salvation; he judges the wicked and was judged for our wickedness; he is the final Davidic king who reigns forever; he is the one who is perfect as our Father is perfect and who has given us his perfection.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

This is one reason I&#8217;d like to see pastors preach through longer sections of more parts of the Bible much more frequently. But more on that in a non-devotional post, some other day. This post is going to be <em>long</em> even as it is.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

Worth note: the original text doesn&#8217;t have any heading between the two chapters, unlike many other breaks.

Which is flatly <em>shocking</em> if you actually step back and read the book as a book, rather than importing your assumptions about what Jesus is doing, and especially if you read it in its canonical context. Here we are, plowing into the Messianic narrative Matthew provides as the first book out of the Old Testament, and with absolutely no reason in the book &#8211; and certainly no clear reason to expect it from the Old Testament &#8211; Jesus suddenly announces that he&#8217;s <em>not</em> here to abolish the Law or the Prophets. We&#8217;ve become so inured to the changes the New Covenant brought that we rarely stop and consider this at all. &#8220;Why in the world,&#8221; we should all be asking, &#8220;would anyone think &#8211; at this point, at least &#8211; that he <em>was</em> going to abolish the Law or the Prophets?&#8221; And then he promptly goes and even further ups the ante&#8230; but more on that back in the non-footnote text.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

I use God&#8217;s self-revealed name because I do not see any warrant in Scripture to follow the Jewish custom of not speaking or writing it.

               <p class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</p>
<p>The Proverbs, in addition to being occasionally hilarious (&#8220;A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it&#8230;&#8221; [Proverbs 17:8] &#8211; magic stone? Didn&#8217;t see that coming), are enormously helpful. It is easy to overlook the wisdom literature, especially Proverbs, as the content isn&#8217;t as obviously theological as much of the rest of the Scriptures. I find it particularly tempting to focus on areas where God is more clearly revealed.</p>
<p>Or perhaps more <em>obviously</em> revealed, since knowing wisdom means knowing the source of wisdom. Indeed, if Jesus became &#8220;wisdom from God&#8221; for us (1 Corinthians 1:30), then knowing wisdom tells us a great deal about theology proper.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Equally, they are <em>valuable</em>. After all, &#8220;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17). All of it &#8211; every word, including Proverbs. Moreover, wisdom is something that must be <em>sought</em>, not merely acquired by happenstance (Proverbs 17:24).</p>
<p>As such, I&#8217;ve increasingly recognized its value to me. It has been a small measure of humbling. And humility, as it turns out, is a topic that comes up time and again in the Proverbs. Reading through chapter 17 today hammered home how essential a quality humility is for the one who would be wise. Wise men &#8211; as contrasted with fools &#8211; quickly take rebuke to the heart (Proverbs 17:10). Do I? Even fools who are silent can seem wise; wise men do not need to be talking all the time to be heard by others (Proverbs 17:28). Do I? Restraining one&#8217;s words and keeping one&#8217;s temper both reflect a measure of understanding (Proverbs 17:27). Do I?</p>
<p>It has become very apparent to me over the past few years that few things are surer signs of mature godliness than deep humility. If you want to judge a man&#8217;s character, look at the areas where he is most successful and where he is least successful, and how he responds in those areas. Does he glorify God in his victories? Does he graciously use his failures as an opportunity to make much of the grace of God that carries him through? Or does he focus on his own accomplishments and perpetually get hung up on his own failures? Is he a braggart, a loudmouth, or easily angered &#8211; or is he slow to speak, slow to become angry, and quick to make peace?</p>
<p>The men I admire most &#8211; the men I most want to emulate &#8211; are all men of deep, quiet humility.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Studying the Proverbs and humbling myself to learn wisdom from God who has given us all the wisdom we need is a good place to start.</p>

I suspect &#8220;loud humility&#8221; would be a contradiction in terms, but gladly I don&#8217;t think that being physically loud by nature automatically disqualifies one from humility; if it did, I wouldn&#8217;t have a chance.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
