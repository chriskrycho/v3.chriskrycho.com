               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>I have ten minutes tonight, so this is going to be a quick (and probably short) set of reflections. I got to Genesis 29 and 30 this evening, and read them together since the former flows neatly into the latter. The short version is: Jacob and his family are a mess, right from the start. If it wasn&#8217;t bad enough the way Jacob left his own family, it quickly becomes apparent that things with Laban won&#8217;t be any better&#8212;indeed, they&#8217;ll be <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>Jacob falls in love with Rachel, makes a deal with her father than he can marry her if he works for seven years. Two thoughts: (1) that&#8217;s serious dedication; (2) I wonder how Rachel felt about the whole thing. Jacob finishes the seven years, Laban throws a party, and then Jacob and Rachel go to bed. Er, except that it&#8217;s Leah. One of my favorite lines in the Old Testament, here: &#8220;And in the morning, behold, it was Leah!&#8221; (Genesis 29:25). I&#8217;m married, and I&#8217;m <em>really</em> not quite sure how that worked.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was always under the impression that Jacob then had to work another 7 years before he got to have Rachel as his wife; as it turns out, he worked those 7 further years <em>after</em> having her as his wife. He had both Leah and Rachel as wives within a week of each other. To any guy that&#8217;s ever been tempted to think polygamy is a good idea, the rest of chapters 29&#8211;30 could be put here precisely to put that notion to rest. You know, with a bullet to the heart. What follows is a tale of sisters who clearly envy each other and see themselves in constant competition with one another, even using their maids as a way to get offspring for themselves.</p>
<p>Seriously: who <em>does</em> that? What woman says, &#8220;Here, go have sex with this <em>other</em> woman so that I can outdo my sister (with whom you are also sleeping) in our competition for having children?&#8221; Different culture, yes,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but still: these people were a <em>mess</em>.</p>
<p>And that right there is one of the greatest comforts in Scripture to me. We have Abraham, the patriarch of the faith, followed by his son Isaac, who repeats his father&#8217;s mistakes and then gets outfoxed by his wife and son&#8217;s trickery. Then comes Jacob, who steals his brother&#8217;s blessing after tricking him out of his birthright, and the twelve sons who become the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel come out of the backbiting and jealousy between the two women he married. <em>This</em> is the cast of characters through whom God is planning to bring blessing to all the nations of the world.</p>
<p>There is a magnificent, beautiful gem that gives a hint of what is coming buried in the middle of this. Throughout all the jealousy, giving of maids, and so on, only once does someone stop and simply praise God: Leah, when Judah is born (Genesis 29:35). And where does that promised blessing come from, ultimately? The line of Judah&#8212;not the firstborn son, but the kid in the middle, who is the only one about whom there is no complaining or wheedling for more, just a simple bit of praise offered to Yahweh.</p>
<p>God is working his plan. Jacob&#8217;s family makes it clear that he can work it just fine with people who are a mess. And in the midst of that mess, the Messianic hope just keeps growing. Praise Yahweh.</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s post is going to sound familiar&#8212;a great deal like last night&#8217;s in many ways, because the topics are similar. Today I come to the Passion itself: Matthew 27. Here, Jesus stands before Pilate, is whipped and mocked and spit on <a href="../../then-they-spit-in-his-face/index.html" >again</a>, and ultimately is crucified.</p>
<p>That word has too little force for us, I think. We Christians are too accustomed to the word &#8220;cross,&#8221; to used to the idea of Jesus being &#8220;crucified.&#8221; We have become inured to the horrifying nature of the image of a man dying in agony because he has had his body nailed to some pieces of wood. The pain was excruciating. Paul points out in Philippians that Jesus was humbled not just to death, but <em>even</em> to death on a cross. And for all that we come back to this idea in sermons from time to time, I think we still are too little aware of how great Jesus&#8217; sufferings were on our behalf.</p>
<p>I am grateful that the Spirit let me see again, just a little, the horror of that moment. The God-man, the Savior-King who came to redeem the world from its sin, hangs there on a few pieces of wood from some trees he created, both upholding the universe by the word of his power and dying in agony, each breath impossibly hard. In a heartbeat he could have said, &#8220;Enough; I will not do this thing!&#8221; but the immeasurable depths of the riches of God&#8217;s kindness and mercy held him there. Not the Father abusing the Son, as some (fools) would have it, but the Son full-willing taking all upon himself as they and the Spirit in perfect unity did what man never could, so that the mercy <em>and</em> the justice of the Triune Godhead would be on display, side by side, forever. Impossible, glorious mystery.</p>
<p>And then the impossible words: &#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221; This, Jesus the eternal Son of God suffered on my behalf: not only the physical agonies of the cross, but somehow&#8212;in a great mystery&#8212;somehow he suffered the agony of relational separation from the Father and the Spirit that we all deserve and have borne in tiniest part, that we might never taste it in full. Somehow he suffered the wrath of the Godhead that we all deserve, so that we might never taste it at all. Impossible, glorious mystery.</p>
<p>He took our thorns&#8212;the thorns that grew from the ground that God cursed for Adam&#8217;s sake&#8212;on his brow. He took the lash on his back. He took the nails in his hands and his side. He took the mockery from Roman soldiers and passersby and wicked thieves hung beside him to die in ignominy. He took it all, that Father and Son and Spirit might pass over our sins and still be <em>good</em>&#8212;that when the Son comes again in power and judgment, we his people will stand clothed in his own righteousness. Impossible, glorious mystery!</p>
<p>So praise him: the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Mighty One of Israel, the Lion, the Lamb, the one from whom the scepter will <em>never</em> depart, the Holy One, the great I Am, in every way a man and very God of very God, Redeemer, God with us, judge and judged, prophesied prophet, sacrifice and priest, servant-king&#8212;Yahweh! Yahweh, merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Hallelujah!</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Matthew waits until he is some 16 chapters into his text<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to start <em>explicitly</em> saying what the whole book has said implicitly thus far, and what the annunciation at the beginning proclaimed loud and clear: Jesus is the Messiah, the one to whom all the hopes and expectations engendered by the Old Testament pointed. &#8220;Who do you say that I am?&#8221; he asks. And Peter&#8217;s answer, ringing down through the ages, is still breath-taking in its assurance and simple truth: &#8220;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&#8221;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of the sermons I have heard on Matthew 16 focus on Peter&#8212;on his statement of the bedrock truth of our faith, or on his need of rebuke just a few verses later, or even on the question of Petrine authority over the church. Not many stop to notice how pivotal this chapter is in the flow of Matthew as a whole. Not many recognize that for the first time, Jesus openly accepts being called the Messiah, and openly proclaims what the Messiah will do&#8212;that is, <em>die</em>. Yes, Peter first got it amazingly, remarkably right and then got it equally amazingly, remarkably wrong. But at least as important here is the picture of who the Messiah is and what he is about.</p>
<p>Matthew spent 15 chapters getting here&#8212;laying the foundation in Jesus&#8217; teaching, his miraculous healings, and specific fulfillments of some prophecies and &#8220;filling up&#8221; of others<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&#8212;so that when Jesus acknowledges Peter&#8217;s claim, the reader is not only unsurprised, but delightedly saying, &#8220;Yes!&#8221; because Jesus&#8217; words and actions to this point confirm everything the prologue declared to be true of him. This is important, in no small part, because then Matthew turns around and hits the reader in the face with the unexpected: Jesus plans to be crucified.</p>
<p>Who <em>plans</em> that? Peter&#8217;s confusion is understandable (even if his response was ultimately so wrong that Jesus aligned Peter with Satan for trying to prevent it). No one plans to be crucified. But this Messiah does. Good thing we&#8217;re already convinced he&#8217;s the Messiah.</p>
<p>And then? Then Jesus tells us that whoever wants to follow him&#8212;whoever wants to &#8220;come after&#8221; him&#8212;needs to embrace that same cross. The call to follow this Messiah isn&#8217;t a call to immediate glory, and a kingdom of this world. It is a call to self-sacrifice, to lose the world and gain one&#8217;s soul. It is a call to live in such a way that when the Son of Man returns with his holy angels in judgment, we will not be ashamed.</p>
<p>As I closed yesterday: Lord come soon!&#8212;but in light of his coming, how shall we live? Come and die, he says. Come and die.</p>

Yes, I know, the chapters weren&#8217;t in the original. It&#8217;s still over halfway through the book.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

Your Bible will say &#8220;Christ&#8221; almost certainly. It isn&#8217;t being used as the titular name here (&#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221;), though; this is Peter declaring his understanding that Jesus was the hoped-for Jewish Messiah.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

It is helpful, when reading through Matthew, to understand that the word our English Bibles translate as &#8220;fulfill&#8221; also has an ordinary, non-prophetic meaning of &#8220;fill up.&#8221; Following G. K. Beale, I actually think it should be translated this way in most of the cases where it appears in Matthew. Many of the otherwise challenging interpretive issues&#8212;what does it <em>mean</em> that he fulfilled thus-and-such a passage which isn&#8217;t talking about him?&#8212;become clear if you understand Matthew to be saying, &#8220;He filled this passage up with more meaning than was there before,&#8221; rather than &#8220;He fulfilled this prophecy that was referring to him [even though it wasn't].&#8221;&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<p>Eschatology is a big word, but it&#8217;s an even bigger concept. The things to come &#8212;the things we do not yet see fully&#8212;are hard to grasp. Not so hard for us, perhaps, as they were for those who came before us. In Genesis 15, Abram<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> received a number of promises. None of them were exactly <em>easy</em> to believe: here he was, closing in on a century old, and his always-barren wife in the same category,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and God promises him a child from his own body. More than that, God promised him descendants that would outnumber the stars, or the sand on the seashore.</p>
<p>That promise has been fulfilled. In fact, it has been fulfilled doubly: first by the nation of Israel, in the course of her long history from Abraham to the time of Christ, and then through those many of us who have been grafted in since then. Just as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness (Genesis 15:6), so we have been counted righteous as we believe God, and now the number of those from the nations dwarfs even that of the Jews.</p>
<p>There is another promise there that wasn&#8217;t fulfilled, though&#8212;at least, not all the way. In verses 18&#8211;21, God promises Abram that his descendants will inherit a <em>massive</em> territory. Israel never did, though. The Hebrews&#8217; national territory, relatively substantial though it was at its peak, certainly never made it anywhere near the Euphrates on its eastern edge. Some might take this an example of the Bible&#8217;s fallibility. I don&#8217;t; I take it instead as a picture of things yet to come.</p>
<p>This kind of eschatological situation is common in the Bible. A promise is made, and the fulfillment comes, but only in part, never wholly. Even the Messianic promises, which we often think of as fulfilled in Christ, remain incomplete. They found their first and partial fulfillment in his first coming, just as the promises to Abraham were fulfilled first, partially, in the nation of Israel, and then again more fully in the nations (you and me, unless you&#8217;re a Jewish convert), and then finally someday when Jesus returns and the New Jerusalem is here on earth.</p>
<p>It is not a stretch to say that &#8220;eschatological hope&#8221;&#8212;mouthful though the phrase may be&#8212;is one of the defining characteristics of Christians. We are the people of &#8220;already but not yet&#8221; who are incomparably glad of what God has already done and impossibly hopeful about what he will someday do.</p>
<p>The nation of Israel got a taste of what the final fulfillment will be like as Jesus walked among them. Matthew 15 reiterates what Matthew 11 first made clear: Jesus is the one who fulfills the promises of God&#8217;s final setting things to rights&#8212;the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. But they did not see it <em>finished</em>. Jesus did not heal every person on the earth; we still have the mute and crippled and lame and blind among us, and all of us yet will die.</p>
<p>But there will come a day when he comes back, and those promises to Abraham are fulfilled in their entirety at last, and the hopes engendered by a prophet offering healing in the first century in Israel are realized. No more tears, no more sorrow, and we will worship our King and enjoy unbroken fellowship with God and one another in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Hallelujah. Lord, come soon.</p>
