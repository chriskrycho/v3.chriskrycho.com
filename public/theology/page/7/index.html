               <p class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</p>
<p>One of the more striking features of the Psalms is the fact that it is so often God&#8217;s <em>righteousness</em> that comforts the Psalmist. In an enormous array of situations, David and the other poet/songwriters who penned the Psalms turn from their distress and are comforted &#8211; but not by the things we might suppose. I find that I tend to look at the kindness and mercy of God when I am struggling. His compassion, his tender heart, and his love are attributes that easily lend themselves to our cultural bent.</p>
<p>Yet when David faced trials (as when he was facing accusations from someone he had thought was friendly toward him), it was often God&#8217;s righteousness he called on.</p>
<p>As I have chewed on this reality through the day, a couple things have become clear. First, I do not spend much time reflecting on the righteousness of God as grounds for my comfort or hope, and I <em>should</em>. David provides a good model to imitate here. When we encounter hostility or persecution &#8211; especially for those of us in ministry &#8211; we have the promise of God&#8217;s correction or vindication to fall back on. This is David&#8217;s pattern in the Psalm: he calls on God to act righteously toward <em>David</em> if he wronged someone at peace with him, and then calls on God to rise up against his enemies if David has been wronged. That&#8217;s a foreign concept to many of us, but perhaps only because we have little experience of suffering for the gospel. For those who <em>do</em> suffer for the gospel, the promise of God&#8217;s righteous vindication is very obviously good news. For those of us who do not often suffer, the promise that God will righteously correct us is good news, too.</p>
<p>Second, given the centrality of the righteousness of God throughout Scripture, this pattern in the Psalms really shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise. It is not an overstatement<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to say that God&#8217;s vindication of his own righteousness is one of the dominant themes of Scripture &#8211; one of the hinges on which everything else turns. It is because of God&#8217;s righteousness that we are saved at all, not only from earthly trials, but from our damnation. Paul makes this clear in Romans 3: Christ died so that God can be both just and the justifier of those who have faith in Jesus. If the narrative of Scripture is the story of God&#8217;s redemption of his people, it is thus <em>necessarily</em> also the story of his vindication of his own righteousness.</p>
<p>We would not want a God who made nothing of sin &#8211; who let envy and gossip and slander and greed slide, to say nothing of rape or murder &#8211; any more than we would want a judge who just shrugs at every misdemeanor or felony. Such a being would not be good or worthy of worship; he would not be <em>righteous</em>. Nor would we find good a God without mercy and love &#8211; he, too, would be unrighteous. But God <em>is</em> righteous, and to show himself righteous he both graciously forgives sins <em>and</em> pays the penalty for those sins.</p>
<p>Because he is righteous, and vindicated his righteousness in graciously showing us his mercy, we are saved. More than that, Jesus became our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30), and now&#8230; Now, we are the very righteousness of God in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:21). Hallelujah.</p>

               <p class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</p>
<p>The Proverbs, in addition to being occasionally hilarious (&#8220;A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it&#8230;&#8221; [Proverbs 17:8] &#8211; magic stone? Didn&#8217;t see that coming), are enormously helpful. It is easy to overlook the wisdom literature, especially Proverbs, as the content isn&#8217;t as obviously theological as much of the rest of the Scriptures. I find it particularly tempting to focus on areas where God is more clearly revealed.</p>
<p>Or perhaps more <em>obviously</em> revealed, since knowing wisdom means knowing the source of wisdom. Indeed, if Jesus became &#8220;wisdom from God&#8221; for us (1 Corinthians 1:30), then knowing wisdom tells us a great deal about theology proper.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Equally, they are <em>valuable</em>. After all, &#8220;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17). All of it &#8211; every word, including Proverbs. Moreover, wisdom is something that must be <em>sought</em>, not merely acquired by happenstance (Proverbs 17:24).</p>
<p>As such, I&#8217;ve increasingly recognized its value to me. It has been a small measure of humbling. And humility, as it turns out, is a topic that comes up time and again in the Proverbs. Reading through chapter 17 today hammered home how essential a quality humility is for the one who would be wise. Wise men &#8211; as contrasted with fools &#8211; quickly take rebuke to the heart (Proverbs 17:10). Do I? Even fools who are silent can seem wise; wise men do not need to be talking all the time to be heard by others (Proverbs 17:28). Do I? Restraining one&#8217;s words and keeping one&#8217;s temper both reflect a measure of understanding (Proverbs 17:27). Do I?</p>
<p>It has become very apparent to me over the past few years that few things are surer signs of mature godliness than deep humility. If you want to judge a man&#8217;s character, look at the areas where he is most successful and where he is least successful, and how he responds in those areas. Does he glorify God in his victories? Does he graciously use his failures as an opportunity to make much of the grace of God that carries him through? Or does he focus on his own accomplishments and perpetually get hung up on his own failures? Is he a braggart, a loudmouth, or easily angered &#8211; or is he slow to speak, slow to become angry, and quick to make peace?</p>
<p>The men I admire most &#8211; the men I most want to emulate &#8211; are all men of deep, quiet humility.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Studying the Proverbs and humbling myself to learn wisdom from God who has given us all the wisdom we need is a good place to start.</p>

I suspect &#8220;loud humility&#8221; would be a contradiction in terms, but gladly I don&#8217;t think that being physically loud by nature automatically disqualifies one from humility; if it did, I wouldn&#8217;t have a chance.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><em>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</em></p>
<p>Genesis 2 stands in stark contrast to Psalms 3 and 4, Proverbs 16, and Matthew 2 in an entirely different way. In Genesis 2, Moses describes the creation of humankind in considerable detail, elaborating and expanding on the description he gave in chapter 1. Everything is good. There is a garden in which man is to work; marriage was instituted but unbroken (and man&#8217;s desire for someone like him was fulfilled), and the world was as it should be.</p>
<p>And David pleads for the aid of God, and notes that he slept and woke again only because Yahweh kept him from the hand of his murderous enemy &#8211; that is, from his <em>son</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arise, O Yahweh!<br />
  Save me, O my God!<br />
  For you strike all my enemies on the cheek;<br />
  you break the teeth of the wicked</p>
<p>Salvation belongs to Yahweh;<br />
  your blessing be on your people!<br />
  &#8212;Psalm 3:7&#8211;8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, in Psalm 4, David pleads for God&#8217;s salvation. These are not the words of a man whose life is painless and perfect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!<br />
  You have given me relief when I was in distress.<br />
  Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!</p>
<p>O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?<br />
  How long will you love vain words and seek after lies?<br />
  &#8212;Psalm 4:1&#8211;2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew, too, has a tale of woe. Herod deceives the wise men who come seeking the Messiah, and then in his rage murders little children. Mothers and fathers saw their young ones struck down because a wicked man thought he could thwart the plan of God &#8211; a plan he misunderstood utterly, though no more than any of his peers.</p>
<p>So there is a sharp and biting contrast between the world of Genesis 2 and the worlds of the Psalms and Matthew. It is in the continuity that I found joy, though: the God of Genesis 2, who made all things good, who delighted to bring the man a helper suitable for him, is the God who is David&#8217;s savior, and who sent angels to protect Joseph and Mary and the God-child. So in a fallen world, David can write not only his pleas for help, but also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself;<br />
  the Lord hears when I call to him.<br />
  &#8212;Psalm 4:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many who say, “Who will show us some good?<br />
  Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!”<br />
  You have put rmore joy in my heart<br />
  than they have when their grain and wine abound.<br />
  &#8212;Psalm 4:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grain and wine are good things; their abounding are a legitimate cause for rejoicing. But knowing God is a better joy, and a great cause for rejoicing.</p>
<p>But above all, in the context of these contrasts, this one phrase (in Psalm 4:1) stands out: &#8220;Oh God of my righteousness.&#8221; David is pleading with the God who is the source of his righteousness. The righteousness that Adam and Eve had is lost &#8211; so broken and twisted and distorted until king kills infants and son seeks to take his own father&#8217;s life. David has nothing (<em>I</em> have nothing) but the righteousness God gives. And that righteousness was in the form of a man. He was made like us in every respect (see Hebrews 2). That little baby had dirty swaddling clothes that his parents had to change; he went through long nights of teething; he was sometimes inexplicably fussy. All that so that I might, with David, call on the God of our righteousness.</p>

               <p><em>I am starting a new discipline: for the next six weeks, I am seeking to follow a specific, simple reading plan I&#8217;ve devised for working through the Scriptures, along with some other personal goals. One of the goals is to write some &#8220;devotional&#8221; reflections every day. As such, I&#8217;ll be sharing thoughts from my morning reading late each day &#8211; after it has had time to marinate and stew all day, and when I have strong incentives to keep the word count (and thus, the amount of time I spend on it) to a minimum. You can expect to see roughly 500 words a day; if I occasionally go long or short you&#8217;ll simply have to forgive me.</em></p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s reading included Genesis 1 and Matthew 1. I was struck, reading through Matthew 1 immediately after Genesis 1, how incredible the story is. The God who made everything &#8211; who spoke the universe into being, who imagined light and darkness, who fashioned the earth with its peaks and its valleys and its vast seas, who filled the land with ferns and flowers and towering trees, who spun the stars through the vast empty span of the heavens, who shaped cetaceans and made mastodons, who capped his creation with feeble, magnificent humanity &#8211; this God stepped into the womb of a woman.</p>
<p>I too rarely feel the force of that: God became a man. The one who made us in his image took on <em>everything</em> that it means to be a human. The ancient divines summed it up magnificently: Jesus partakes of everything that it is to be human, and he is at the same time everything that it is to be God. In magnificent, marvelous mystery, he was both a rapidly splitting mass of cells in the body of a young Jewish woman in Palestine, and still upholding the universe by the word of his power.</p>
<p>This is too great a thing for our minds to grasp. That God who made all things has dwelt among us? This is myth, or the greatest of all possible jests. And indeed, it is both: myth come true (and every heart should leap to hear just one of the fairy-story endings come true), and a cause for laughter in the same vein as (but so much grander than) a platypus. There is nothing to top it &#8211; save perhaps the doctrine of the Trinity. <em>There</em> is one to make your head spin and your heart leap and set the world on its ear.</p>
<p>The God who made Adam is now also the son of David, the son of Abraham. (As Luke adds: the son of Adam.) Preposterous? Yes. Wonderful? Yes. Too good to be true? No: it is the one of the only things good <em>enough</em> to be true.</p>
<p>God made all things, then became one of the things he made and did not stop being god. Hallelujah.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:2&#8211;16 is one of the most controversial passages in modern hermeneutics. The plain meaning of the text is straightforward: Paul argues that men ought to have their heads uncovered and women ought to have their heads covered when praying or prophesying in the church. The interpretive challenge stems from three interwoven issues.</p>
<p>First, the interpreter must decide how to resolve a number of perplexing textual difficulties in the passage. Second, since Paul&#8217;s injunction seems to be culturally situated&#8212;no one today wears clothing remotely like that of Paul&#8217;s day, head coverings included&#8212;interpreters must decide how to respond to Paul&#8217;s instructions. It is impossible to follow his instructions as the recipients of his letter would, as it is unclear exactly what the &#8220;head covering&#8221; was. Moreover, as will be seen, Paul&#8217;s argument is complex, leaning on a combination of the creation order, and a universal sense of what is appropriate to men and women. Thus, correct interpretation must respect both the creation order and variations in cultural perceptions of propriety. Third, the interpretation of the passage&#8217;s comments on the &#8220;headship&#8221; relationship between men and women have been the subject of much controversy. These difficulties notwithstanding, Paul&#8217;s central thesis remains clear: men and women ought to dress in a way that demonstrates the differences between the genders. <a href="../../head-coverings-an-exegesis-of-1-corinthians-11_2-16/index.html"  class="more-link">Read on, intrepid explorer &rarr;</a></p>

               <p class="editorial">The following paper was prepared for Dr. Jeremy Evan&#8217;s introductory philosophy class.</p>
<hr />
<p>Among the many interesting philosophical tangles woven into <em>The Dark Knight</em> by the Nolan brothers, one of the most interesting is the film&#8217;s implicit contrast between a set of conflicting moral visions: the constrained utilitarianism of Batman himself, the nihilistic amoralism proclaimed by the Joker, and the quiet objectivism displayed by Lucius Fox and Rachel Dawes. Of these, Batman&#8217;s utilitarianism is both most dynamic and most interesting in the broader context of the Nolan canon. The objectivist position of Fox and Dawes and the anarchist angle espoused by the Joker are both essentially static points that provide contrasts with Batman&#8217;s philosophy throughout the second film. Meanwhile, the ethical dilemmas Bruce faces here provoke him to confront at a deeper level the questions raised by the radical utilitarianism of the League of Shadows in the movies that precede and follow <em>The Dark Knight</em>. As a result, Batman transforms from the idealistic, restrained utilitarian&#8212;at times almost an objectivist&#8212;of the first movie into a compromised, decidedly <em>not</em> objectivist utilitarian by the conclusion of the second film.  <a href="../../objectivism-and-utilitarianism-in-the-dark-knight-rises/index.html"  class="more-link">Read on, intrepid explorer &rarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="center">Colossians 1:13&#8211;23</h2>
<h3>The meaning of the text</h3>
<p>Christ is supremely worthy of worship. The Father made all things by and through Christ, for Christ, who now sustains all things. In Christ, the Father is reconciling all things to himself, making peace for us by the blood of his cross. He is the very image of God, and in him God dwells fully. He is the firm foundation of believers’ salvation and sanctification, and his person and deeds are the center of the gospel to which believers are called. <a href="../../he-who-made-all-things-restores-all-things/index.html"  class="more-link">Read on, intrepid explorer &rarr;</a></p>
