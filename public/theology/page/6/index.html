               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p><i class=editorial>Note that there are two quite distinct sections to today&#8217;s post. Don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re done just because you got to the first &#8216;Hallelujah&#8217;!</i></p>
<h2>Thinking Through Matthew 10 Again</h2>
<p>As I told <a href="http://jaimiedawn.blogspot.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://jaimiedawn.blogspot.com']);" title="I'm hoping if I link to her blog she'll post again!">Jaimie</a> tonight, I have long found Matthew 10:31 to be one of those verses that is simultaneously comforting and a little funny. There is simply something a touch odd about the way it comes through in English:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (ESV)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in translations which generally prioritize a smoother reading (rather than the more literalistic approach favored by e.g. the ESV, NASB, etc.), end up with a phrase that is just, well, a little funny to read:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So donâ€™t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. (NIV2011)
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I worked through the surrounding chapter more carefully, though, the verse came home in a way that it never had before (even if I still think, and probably will always think, that it reads a little funny in English).</p>
<p>In Matthew 10, Jesus sends out his twelve disciples<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to do the same kinds of work he had been doing: casting out demons, healing people of their diseases, cleansing lepers, and even raising people from the dead. The comments that follow were his commission statements to his disciples. These are, notably, not exactly the cheeriest commissioning statements one might think to offer: they include not only the strong implication that the disciples <em>would</em> be rejected, but the promise of persecution even from within one&#8217;s own family and an incredibly heightened sense of the cost of discipleship. Following Jesus and taking his name to the nations is not child&#8217;s play, but hard and costly work.</p>
<p>And it is in this context that we find the somewhat amusing quote cited above&#8212;specifically, as Jesus warns his disciples <em>not</em> to act out of fear of man. The context makes the sentence much more serious: Jesus has just said that they should not fear men, who can kill only the body, but should instead fear God, who can destroy both body and soul in hell. He <em>follows</em> the statement with the promise that he will acknowledge before the Father those who acknowledge him before men&#8230; and <em>deny</em> before the Father those who deny him before men. The word about the sparrows, then&#8212;the promise that God cares about even the sparrows, and so much more for his children&#8212;is an enormously comforting thought when situated as it is in its context of prophesied persecution and hardship for those who follow Christ.</p>
<p>I am worth more than many sparrows. Hallelujah: I can proclaim Christ without fear of man.</p>
<h2>Genealogies Are Fun, Right?</h2>
<p>I also read Genesis 10 today. This is one of those lists of names that we generally find boring and pointless. However, if we affirm the divine inspiration of Scripture&#8212;that is, if we really believe that the Holy Spirit superintended the composition of these books so that we have everything we need, and we need everything we have&#8212;then there is a reason that there are lists of names in the Bible. I can think of several immediately: First, they are important in many cultures, even if not our own, as markers of historicity and authenticity. Second, they serve as markers for the reality that God is and always has been aware of the minutiae of even our genealogies. Third, and perhaps most significantly, they are part of the framework by which God communicates his ongoing work in history, culminating in the lists of names that come early in both Matthew&#8217;s and Luke&#8217;s gospel accounts. These are not mere random lists of names; they are part of the way God made sure that everyone could see that <em>he kept his promise</em>.</p>
<p>Tonight, I noticed one more of the tiny little pieces of Scripture that goes along with that. At the end of Genesis 10, Moses makes a neat little literary move that I had never caught before: he introduces the word &#8220;nations&#8221; into the narrative for the first time. Now, that might be mildly interesting if I didn&#8217;t know where things were going&#8212;but I do. I know that in just a matter of a few chapters, God will promise explicitly to make a <em>nation</em> that blesses all the families of the earth through Abraham. Just chapters after that, he will use the same word to promise that all the <em>nations</em> of the earth will be blessed through Abraham&#8217;s seed. This idea grows ever more prominent throughout the Old Testament: God will use Israel to bless the nations. It flowers into full fruition in the coming of Christ and his commission to his disciples: to preach the gospel to all the <em>nations</em>. Again: God keeps his promises, and even the dry little details like genealogies fit into the big picture of his glorious redemptive work in history, culminating in Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Adam, the son of God.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Jesus, upon finishing the Sermon on the Mount, came down from the mountain and immediately continued setting the world on its head. &#8220;Do not think that I came to abolish [the Law or the Prophets],&#8221; he said; &#8220;I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them&#8221; (Matthew 5:17). The statement <a href="../../four-books-five-passages-one-messiah/index.html#fn:3" >seems a bit mysterious at the time</a>, but suddenly it becomes a bit clearer, because the things Jesus does when he comes down from the mountain are, well&#8230; surprising, and not always in line with the Law and the Prophets as the people understood them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, he not only heals a leper, but does so by <em>touching</em> said leper. Jesus immediately became ceremonially unclean.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> He then instructs the leper to fulfill the rest of the Mosaic Law&#8212;after having forfeited his own cleanness for that man&#8217;s sake in a way that ran directly contrary to the understanding of his peers about the intent of that Law.</p>
<p>The next narrative section is just as surprising&#8212;or it should be, if we were not so inured to it by familiarity. A centurion in the Roman army&#8212;the occupiers and oppressors of Israel&#8212;comes to him and asks him to heal his servant. Jesus makes the first surprising move simply by acquiescing to the request: &#8220;I will come and heal him,&#8221; he says (v. 7). And then things become truly surprising. First, the centurion rejects Jesus&#8217; offer to come, arguing that Jesus need only speak and whatever he says will be done&#8212;to which Jesus replies that he has not seen any such measure of faith among Israel, and promptly heals the man&#8217;s servant. <em>Then</em> he tells everyone that people from all over the world will come sit at God&#8217;s table while the &#8220;sons of the kingdom&#8221; (the biological heirs of the promise to Abraham) will be kicked out.</p>
<p>So now in the span of a few verses, Jesus has touched a leper, proclaimed a Gentile superior in his faith to anyone he had encountered in all Israel, and then announced that the fulfillment of the Messianic promises of the nations coming into Israel would coincide not with Israel&#8217;s exaltation but her disgrace. Coming to Matthew after reading the Old Testament, these announcements prompt mingled affirmation and confusion&#8212;affirmation, because yes, these are the things God promised; but confusion, because the way they are coming is not <em>exactly</em> what one would expect.</p>
<p>Jesus heals more people of sickness and demons. Then he calms a storm (to which his disciples, traveling with him, can say only, &#8220;What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?&#8221;&#8212;immediately after pleading for him to save them; see Matthew 8:25&#8211;27). That one took me aback a little bit, in at least two ways: (1) These men who had been following Jesus around watching him perform miracles, even to the point that they thought he might be able to do <em>something</em> while they were threatened by the weather, were astounded by what he actually did.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (2) He calmed a storm. Jesus spoke, and the storm calmed and the waves went away. <em>He was God.</em> Not just a powerful prophet, not just a man used of God, but God himself, and it showed. The point comes home again when he casts out yet more demons and sends them into a herd of pigs&#8212;he has the authority to do that!</p>
<p>Sometimes slowing down and thinking about the books, especially in their settings in the Bible as a whole, helps me see things more clearly. In this case, it makes it much more obvious why the people found Jesus so confusing: he doesn&#8217;t do anything the &#8220;right&#8221; way, and he was always doing things that took people&#8217;s breath away, because he was <em>God</em> and man. More&#8212;much more&#8212;than they expected in their Messiah. Someone not only to follow to the worship of God in the new age, but God himself, to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

It strikes me that this is a major part of what Jesus does for us: he comes to us, and touches us, and becomes <em>unclean</em> that we might be healed of our infirmities.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<li id="fn:2">
It is also striking that he rebukes his closest followers for their little faith immediately after commending a Gentile for his great faith. So often we think, &#8220;If I could just walk with Jesus, it would be so much easier to believe.&#8221; The Bible bears witness in so many ways that this way of thinking is simply wrong&#8212;profoundly wrong.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><i class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>I find Genesis 6&#8211;8 to be some of the most challenging passages in all of Scripture. The account of Noah and his family and many animals boarding a boat and surviving a worldwide flood by the mercy of God is an amazing picture of both God&#8217;s wrath against sin and his mercy to those who call on him. I do not find the passage difficult for theological reasons, so much (though I understand why others wrestle with the section there), but for the difficulty they present in reconciling the Scriptures with the evidence of the world around us.</p>
<p>I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics and I spend a substantial part of my time outside of seminary working as a software developer. Science is deep in my soul; the way the universe ticks has always fascinated me and the way we study the universe no less so. The combination of these pieces leaves me able to understand&#8212;far better than many of my peers&#8212;just how odd the narrative seems scientifically.</p>
<p>There are plenty of parts of the history that do not trouble me at all. That God <em>could</em> miraculously flood the entire earth is not a matter of doubt in the least. That he could miraculously carry people and animals through the flood is likewise unproblematic for me. Even the repopulation of the earth with animals from what was an impossibly small sample<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> when compared to the nearly incomprehensible biodiversity that characterizes our world is as nothing for the one who made all things.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> God made the universe; he is perfectly capable of managing a worldwide flood without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The problem, from my point of view, is that&#8212;all the arguments to the contrary of Ken Ham and his fellow travelers notwithstanding&#8212;there is not a shred of credible evidence for a worldwide flood in the geological record. It is an item that must be taken purely on faith, and not only on faith but on faith that runs exactly contrary to all the best evidence otherwise available to us. For a faith that sets as its capstone the historicity of a miracle, this is troublesome.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Granting that scientific evidence is always open to revision, the best we have right now says, &#8220;This didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221; That leaves me in a strange spot.</p>
<p>The spot is strange precisely <em>because</em> ours is a historical faith, and because I am confident&#8212;absolutely confident&#8212;that 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ really did rise from the dead, and he really is enthroned at the right hand of God the Father in heaven right now,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and he really is coming back to set all things to rights. I believe his word, and I believe that the Scriptures are true. The historical evidence is amazing; the testimony from the internal coherence of Scripture itself is remarkable; and I and many others have personally witnessed the power of God in the lives of believers and unbelievers alike&#8212;to heal people, to deliver from demons, and to radically transform people from those who <em>hate</em> God to those who <em>love</em> him. I <em>believe</em> and <em>trust</em> in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And I have <em>no</em> idea what to do with Genesis 6&#8211;8 other than to continue asking questions in a posture of faith seeking understanding.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> I believe the passage, because it is the word of God, though I do not understand it yet. But&#8212;for now&#8212;that is enough. Jesus does not require that we understand every last thing, and he does not demand that we set aside all our questions; he requires only that we believingly obey him even as we continue asking in faith that he will ultimately answer us (and more, that he will ultimately satisfy us more than the answers will). And so as I continue seeking how best to understand this passage, I will also continue worshipping my risen, reigning God-Man Savior-King.</p>

               <p><i class='editorial'>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Matthew 6 includes one of the more provocative statements and approaches to personal holiness anywhere in the Bible. Coming out of the &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8230;&#8221; section in chapter 5, chapter 6 transitions to a series of statements that include, &#8220;&#8230;they have their reward. But you&#8230;&#8221; The whole sequence hammers home the cost of public practice of holiness for the eyes of men. The cost, it turns out, is that one gets exactly what one was seeking&#8211;but that turns out not to be much of a prize at all.</p>
<p>The adulation of men, in the final reckoning, is a short-lived thing that satisfies no one. Our hearts were made for something deeper, truer, and richer than the admiration of other people: we were made to be satisfied by God&#8217;s delight in us and our delight in him. When we please <em>God</em>, we have grounds for real joy. When we simply earn the admiring looks of other men by performing all our good deeds to be noticed&#8230; well, we have our reward. We get the attention we want from people, but miss all the real joy in those good deeds&#8211;deeds God intended to proceed from our love for him, and which, when they come instead from a desire to be loved by people, become just one more form of idolatry.</p>
<p>And idolatry, it must be said, is a very great part of what got us all into this mess in the first place. So to the man who embraces his man-pleasing ways, and especially to the man who uses &#8220;holiness&#8221; and good works as a means to earning the favor of other people, God says, &#8220;Okay. You got your prize. But that is all there is for you so long as you are pursuing the affections and attentions of other people over and above me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t satisfy.</p>
<p>All the more striking is the placement of the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s prayer&#8221; here, right in the middle of this section. Matthew seems intent on hammering home that no part of our spiritua life&#8211;prayer included&#8211;is excluded from Jesus&#8217; critique. The prayer he offers is simple, to the point, and without the flourishes that too often characterize my own ways of approaching God. More, this prayer is to be offered in private, in the closet, where only God hears. Who else actually needs to hear our prayers? Can anyone else answer them? Can anyone else do <em>anything</em> about them&#8211;except find us worthy of admiration?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is particularly hard-hitting for me, because I have sometimes wondered, &#8220;Did others agree with what I prayed?&#8221; when, during times of corporate prayer there was little verbal affirmation of my own prayers. (I have wondered such things the <em>most</em> when there was verbal affirmation of others&#8217; prayers but not of mine. Ever &#8220;Amen&#8221; suddenly seemed a mark for or against me, depending on who was praying when it came out.) Yet, plainly put, that is simply this same idolatry: wanting my prayer to be affirmed by the people around me. I ought instead strive to please God in the way I pray, and rest confident that he hears and responds.</p>
<p>Conviction. Hallelujah.</p>

This is of course not an argument against corporate prayer. It is, instead, an argument against prayer for <em>attention</em>, which can happen in many ways and many places, including corporate prayer&#8230; but one could, in fact, very easily make a big deal out of going in the closet for long periods of prayer, simply to earn the admiration of other believers. <em>You already have your prize.</em>&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<p><i class='editorial'>On Sundays, I will be using this space as an opportunity to reflect publicly on the sermon presented.</i></p>
<p>Over this summer, our regular teaching pastor, Andy Davis, is on sabbatical, working on a number of writing and ministry projects. As such, the other pastors have been rotating through<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and working through 1 Corinthians. Today, Ron Halbrooks taught through 1 Corinthians 9:19&#8211;23, in which Paul famously traces out the ways he surrendered his own rights for the sake of the gospel and encourages the Corinthians to imitate his example. Ron focused on three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Paul made himself a slave to all. Paul&#8217;s surrender of his own rights was one of the means by which he advanced the gospel: he made sure there was nothing &#8211; really nothing! &#8211; of his own preferences that he would not give up for the sake of people&#8217;s believing in Christ. Though he refused to compromise when people wanted to add requirements to the gospel, he refused to let any non-essential get in the way of his ministry. Ron exhorted us to follow Paul&#8217;s example, and especially to consider the preferences we struggle to overcome in reaching out to those who do not yet follow Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cultural setting: Paul was sensitive to the particular areas in which he needed to make changes. There were plenty of things neither Jews nor Gentiles cared about, and areas where one group was fixated on things the other was not. As Paul went about his ministry, he paid attention to these differences and adapted accordingly. When he was with the Jews, he carefully followed the law; when he was with Gentiles, he had no such concern (how would they have known one way or the other?). Ron pointed out that we need to do the same: do we need to overcome language gaps or be thoughtful of the kinds of food people like? Can we set aside preferences we hold strongly that are merely cultural in order to win others to Christ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save <em>some</em>. The goal of Paul&#8217;s ministry was to save some. He did not make these sacrifices just because he could (who would want that?), and he did not take the salvation of souls lightly. He aimed to bring about people&#8217;s <em>salvation</em>, not merely to educate or inform the world. As such, there was an urgency and an intensity about his actions we would do well to imitate. Because Paul&#8217;s goal was not mere education or even cultural change, but eternal salvation, he was moved to take significant or even drastic measures in pursuit of that goal. We, too, ought to consider the goal sufficiently significant as to motivate us so deeply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ron concluded by exhorting the congregation to take a number of practical steps forward in response to Paul&#8217;s example. First, he challenged the congregation to intensify its efforts in sending members out on mission to the world, whether as international missionaries or as domestic church planters. Second, he exhorted us all to intentionally reach out to those in our community who are unlike us &#8211; whether internationals with whom we do not share even language, or simply people from a different cultural background (e.g. white folks having black folks over for dinner and vice versa).</p>
<hr />
<p><i class='editorial'>I am also translating the sermon passage from Greek whenever applicable sometime Saturday or Sunday morning for my own profit; I will supply these translations, with some brief commentary, at the end of my reflections in case anyone is curious and wants to see my progress.</i></p>
<h2>1 Corinthians 9:19&#8211;23</h2>
<h3>Chris Krycho&#8217;s translation</h3>
<blockquote><p>
  For, though being myself free from all, I made myself a slave to all, in order that I might gain many. And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those under the law as under the law (though not myself being under the law), that I might gain those under the law; to those outside the law as one outside the law (though not myself being outside the law with respect to God, but rather subject to Christ) that I might gain those outside the law; I became weak to those who are weak, that I might gain the weak; I have become all things to all people that by all means I might save some. And I do all for the sake of the gospel, so that I might become a participant in it.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>ESV</h3>
<blockquote><p>
  For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>NIV(2011)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h3>
<blockquote><p>
  Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from Godâ€™s law but am under Christâ€™s law), so as to win those not having the law. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You will note that the translations overlap quite substantially. Both the ESV and NIV add periods and fill in the phrase &#8220;I became&#8221; where I used semicolons and left the phrase out in most cases. My translation is more &#8220;literal,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not more <em>accurate</em>. The sentence I wrote is better Greek than English; that sort of &#8220;piling on&#8221; of phrases was <em>good</em> form for them, but it&#8217;s what we call a run-on sentence in English. Even with semicolons, it&#8217;s just not the best way of putting it; if I were to go back and smooth this out I&#8217;d add those in just as the ESV and NIV have.</p>
<p>You can see, though, that this is a pretty straightforward passage, and not particularly contentious. The ESV and NIV, though they have somewhat different translation philosophies, ended up with <em>very</em> similar results here, and even my own rough, first-pass translation came fairly close to their carefully studied work. Some passages are like this &#8211; they make for a nice change of pace from those which are difficult or ambiguous.</p>
<p>The final sentence is most interesting: I&#8217;ve left it rough on purpose, but it&#8217;s clear that something is sort of missing in my translation. Both the NIV and the ESV supply &#8220;blessings&#8221; and translate the sentence accordingly, with some variations as to the syntax. This is interesting, because it&#8217;s being <em>inferred</em> from the text. I&#8217;m quite curious about why they&#8217;re inferring this, as the UBS<sup>4</sup> Greek New Testament simply doesn&#8217;t have a word for &#8220;blessing&#8221; present. I&#8217;ll probably go look this up in a commentary somewhere to see, because I&#8217;m curious.</p>

I think this is <em>great</em>. Given a choice, I would advocate strongly for much more frequently pulpit rotation, and for that matter against the idea of a &#8220;senior pastor&#8221; at all.

Yes, I know the SBC passed a resolution arguing against the NIV2011. While I have concerns with certain interpretive moves the NIV2011 made, I have nearly identical concerns (albeit in different places and different directions) with some of the translations the ESV has made &#8211; and the same with the HCSB, the NASB, the NKJV, and so on. No translation is perfect, and the NIV2011 is in general a <em>very</em> good translation.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<p><i class='editorial'>And yes, I missed yesterday&#8217;s post. I did that on purpose, because I decided that celebrating my fourth anniversary with my wife was <strong>much</strong> more important than writing a 500-word blog post. Perhaps because I missed that one, or perhaps because I&#8217;m simply in a verbose mood tonight, you&#8217;re getting more than the usual 500 words in the main text, and a <strong>lot</strong> more if you count the footnotes.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>One of the interesting things about tackling multiple sections of Scripture at the same time is seeing the ways they shine light on each other. If we affirm &#8211; as I do &#8211; that Scripture is inspired not only in its individual parts but as a whole book, as a <em>canon</em>, then putting the pieces together can make all of them make more sense.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Today, for example, I was reading in Genesis 4, Psalms 9 and 10, Proverbs 20, and Matthew 5. One would not necessarily expect these five (counting each of the Psalms as a distinct reading<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) disparate texts to particularly overlap in their content.</p>
<p>In a way, that expectation is not far wrong. Genesis 4 highlights Cain&#8217;s murder of Abel, his offspring&#8217;s worsening sin, and the birth of Seth and his son Enosh. The Psalms both focus on God&#8217;s righteousness and sovereign rule over the earth, though from different angles &#8211; in the first, David expresses thanksgiving for God&#8217;s judgment on evildoers; in the second, he offers a pained plea for God to judge wicked men who seem to get away with their sin. Proverbs, as is typical for The Proverbs of Solomon (chapters 10&#8211;24), is a mix without a particular focus. Matthew 5 contains the first part of Jesus&#8217; teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, including the beatitudes, his declaration that he has not come to abolish but to fulfill the law,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and his series of &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8230;&#8221; statements.</p>
<p>Genesis 4 hammers home that sin <em>escalates</em>. It is a matter of mere sentences from the time God removes Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden to the time their first son murders their second son in a fit of jealousy. It is only a few <em>more</em> sentences before one of Cain&#8217;s descendants is boasting about how he will kill a man over trivial offenses. Things start bad and get worse in a hurry. The end of the chapter &#8211; and the end of the section that started in chapter 2 &#8211; gives a little hope, though: when Adam and Eve have Seth, Eve declares that God has given her an &#8220;offspring,&#8221; a <em>seed</em>: the very word God used to promise the one who would crush the serpent&#8217;s head, and the word that becomes a touchstone throughout the rest of Scripture to point to the coming Messiah. <em>Then</em> people began to call on the name of Yahweh.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>David was the anointed king of Israel. He was the first fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to set the crown in the line of Judah, and that promise in turn was part of God&#8217;s Messianic promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In both of these Psalms, though, his focus is on the righteous reign of Yahweh as the hope of the oppressed against the wicked. In both the prayer of thanksgiving (Psalm 9) and the imprecatory prayer (Psalm 10), David ultimately returns to Yahweh&#8217;s eternal reign as the hope of the righteous over and against the predations of the wicked. Yet, as the second psalm makes clear, Yahweh does not <em>seem</em> to be reigning at the moment.</p>
<p>The Proverbs of Solomon <a href="../../learning-humility/index.html">rarely</a> dive directly into theology proper or what we might call &#8220;theological anthropology.&#8221; The focus is nearly always on enormously practical observations about life &#8211; the sorts of things that really are profitable to make us wise, but which do not directly tell us about the character of God or our relationship to him. They are, instead, focused on wisdom that God has given us to be able to live wisely in this world, broken as it is. In the middle of this set of Proverbs, however, are a pair of statements that caught my attention because they <em>are</em> more theologically elevated, as it were. Verse 9 reads, &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin&#8217;?&#8221; and verse 12 reads, &#8220;The hearing ear and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made them both.&#8221; Between the two the author suddenly and sharply reminds the reader that God made all things, and that no one is capable of making himself righteous or pure in heart &#8211; and so all are accountable before God who is creator and judge.</p>
<p>Finally, in Matthew Jesus takes the high bar of the righteousness demanded by the Law and the Prophets, and modeled by the Pharisees, and sets it incredibly higher. The final of his &#8220;You have heard it said&#8230; but I say&#8221; sayings ends thus: &#8220;You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#8221; This is <em>impossibly</em> higher. The just and righteous God who made all things, who really is reigning and who does judge the wicked even if it does not always seem so, demands that we be <em>perfect</em>. But this same God promised a seed who would set things to right &#8211; a promise he was honoring and keeping, Matthew has made clear already, right down through Jesus.</p>
<p>When Jesus says he hasn&#8217;t come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them &#8211; when he continues by saying they won&#8217;t pass away until they are <em>completely</em> fulfilled &#8211; and then promptly makes it clear that no one is going to fulfill them <em>but</em> him, Proverbs 20:9 comes back to mind. &#8220;Who can say, &#8216;I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin&#8217;?&#8221; No one &#8211; but Jesus. He made all things; he fulfilled the law; his heart was pure and clean; he is the seed; he is the one on whom people call for salvation; he judges the wicked and was judged for our wickedness; he is the final Davidic king who reigns forever; he is the one who is perfect as our Father is perfect and who has given us his perfection.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>

This is one reason I&#8217;d like to see pastors preach through longer sections of more parts of the Bible much more frequently. But more on that in a non-devotional post, some other day. This post is going to be <em>long</em> even as it is.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
Worth note: the original text doesn&#8217;t have any heading between the two chapters, unlike many other breaks. As such, it is possible they should be viewed as connected, at least to some extent: the editor of the Psalms grouped and arranged them in a particular way for a reason. Again: more on that some other day.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
Which is flatly <em>shocking</em> if you actually step back and read the book as a book, rather than importing your assumptions about what Jesus is doing, and especially if you read it in its canonical context. Here we are, plowing into the Messianic narrative Matthew provides as the first book out of the Old Testament, and with absolutely no reason in the book &#8211; and certainly no clear reason to expect it from the Old Testament &#8211; Jesus suddenly announces that he&#8217;s <em>not</em> here to abolish the Law or the Prophets. We&#8217;ve become so inured to the changes the New Covenant brought that we rarely stop and consider this at all. &#8220;Why in the world,&#8221; we should all be asking, &#8220;would anyone think &#8211; at this point, at least &#8211; that he <em>was</em> going to abolish the Law or the Prophets?&#8221; And then he promptly goes and even further ups the ante&#8230; but more on that back in the non-footnote text.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
I use God&#8217;s self-revealed name because I do not see any warrant in Scripture to follow the Jewish custom of not speaking or writing it. When you see <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span> in the Old Testament and it&#8217;s in small caps (as it is there if you have a decent, modern web browser), that&#8217;s &#8220;Yahweh.&#8221;&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
