               <p>There are times when the goals we set ourselves&#8212;like writing a blog post about one&#8217;s devotions every night&#8212;come second to the more important things in our lives. Things like spending time with the people we love, especially when they are facing struggles in their lives. It is easy to allow good goals to supercede the reasons and meaning for those goals. I want to write every day because it is good for me. I want to love my wife well <em>much</em> more than I want to write every night, though, and as such, I spent time with her instead of writing on my normal devotional topic, because she was having a bad day.<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This sort of decision is one that I have learned time and again is at the root of expressing Christ-like love to others, and especially in marriage. We, like Christ, are to die to ourselves and love others by setting aside what would be most immediately pleasurable for us and seeking instead the good of the other&#8212;at whatever cost to ourselves. This is not easy; indeed it can be painful and difficult at times to set aside one&#8217;s own desires for the good of others.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But the reward&#8212;oh, the reward is far greater than the price we pay.</p>
<p>We see this in Christ&#8217;s work for us: he endured the cross, scorning its shame&#8212;but not simply because doing so was good on its own merits. Rather, the joy that he expected as the outcome of his doing so was the impetus behind his actions. Lest we think him acting selfishly, his joy is in our salvation and the Father&#8217;s glory. As C. S. Lewis points out,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> real joy is <em>always</em> found in seeking the good of others, rather than pursuing our own selfish ends. The joys we find in gratifying our own desires, rather than seeking to bless others, are shallow, pitiful things that fade quickly and are bitter in the end. The joy we find in seeking to put others first&#8212;above all, seeking to put God first&#8212;is lasting, profound, and sweet even in times of trial or pain.</p>
<p>So when tempted to do your own thing, don&#8217;t. Seek the joy God has set before you&#8212;the joy that comes in being sanctified, that comes in knowing God as he really is, that comes in finding the beauty and the value of others to be so much better than whatever selfish pursuit you might embrace instead. Die to yourself, lose the world, and gain everything. The alternative is to gain something temporarily, but lose <em>everything</em> in the end. Seek your joy where it is truly to be found: in loving God with all your heart and loving your neighbor&#8212;which is to say, that stranger on the side of the road, and also your spouse&#8212;as yourself.</p>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<h2>He Saw Yahweh</h2>
<p>In Genesis 18, Abraham has just finished following God&#8217;s instructions about circumcision. At 100 years old, he circumcised himself, along with his 13-year-old son and all his servants and the other members of his household, to obey this God who had called him from his homeland to a place where he would always be a sojourner, looking forward with hope to the homeland God had promised but which he himself would not inherit. (There is real obedience for you: embrace circumcision so that someone <em>else</em> will get the reward God promises&#8230;)</p>
<p>Then, sitting in the shade one hot afternoon, Abraham looks and sees Yahweh,<sup id="fnref:G-1"><a href="#fn:G-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> standing there as a man he recognizes. At that point, this 100-year-old man (who, granted, lived to be 160 and therefore was probably like a man in his mid to late 50s physically) got up and <em>ran</em> to prepare a feast for his God. There are many interesting things in this passage, but most notable to me tonight was the way Yahweh came to Abraham and interacted with him throughout the passage. That is: he came as a man<sup id="fnref:G-2"><a href="#fn:G-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and ate with Abraham and spoke with him. Of course, he spoke prophetically about impossibilities that he was going to bring about; this condescension was not his ceasing to be God but his taking on a form so that Abraham could know him.</p>
<p>So here we have at once two concrete realities that continue to shape the reader&#8217;s expectations for what God will do in the future: the promise of a miraculous son born to bring about his promise, and Yahweh himself coming as a man to relate to his people.</p>
<h2>Over the Waters</h2>
<p>Coming after a series of prayerful Psalms, the 29th is a complete change in tone. Each of the Psalms preceding it are prayers for deliverance from evildoers and from Yahweh&#8217;s judgment on one&#8217;s own wickedness. Here, though, we have David calling on the heavenly host to ascribe to Yahweh all the glory he is due, and a crescendo of declarations of the power of Yahweh&#8217;s voice. This God of glory<sup id="fnref:P-1"><a href="#fn:P-1" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> is over all, his voice thundering and shaking even the greatest things on this earth. He is worthy for the heavenly host to ascribe him glory and strength, to be worshipped in the splendor of holiness. He is enthroned in his temple; he sits as king <em>forever</em>.</p>
<p>And this is the God who walked with Abraham, who let Abraham challenge him and his judgments. The Judge of all the earth, whose powerful and majestic voice can cause an earthquake or strip the forest bare, has become <em>one of us</em>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:G-1">
This passage highlights one more reason why I prefer simply to use God&#8217;s self-revealed name: early on, Abraham calls him &#8220;lord,&#8221; but not &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>,&#8221; which is simply confusing if you&#8217;re not paying close attention.&#160;<a href="#fnref:G-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn:G-2">
Apparently pre-incarnate Christ, semi- or pseudo-incarnate, which is curious, but <em>not</em> the point of the passage.&#160;<a href="#fnref:G-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<li id="fn:P-1">
This relatively innocuous phrase, right in the middle of verse 3, has been one of the most important in my life. Five years ago, reading through the Psalms much as I am right now, the phrase leapt out at me, because I had no idea what it meant to describe Yahweh as the &#8220;God of glory.&#8221; A month later, my whole theological framework had been turned on its head, from the anthropocentric view that unfortunately characterizes too much evangelical theology, to a radically God-centered view that accords with the Scriptural picture of a God who is working all things for his own sake, and not because of us at all&#8212;though how greatly we benefit!&#160;<a href="#fnref:P-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p>The best summary I&#8217;ve seen from a white guy on the complexity of race relations:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I often feel like we are drowning in the sins of the past. Working at this is like swimming across of river of mud. Every inch of progress is hard-won, and the shore seems far away. When I taught US History, I emphasized that slavery was not only a sin, it was a systematic sin infecting an entire culture, and such sins have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>  What does one do for the man who is on the losing end of this cycle? Perhaps he has come to the point in his life where he wants to get things straightened out. Perhaps he realizes that it isn’t all someone else’s fault, and that he needs to take responsibility. We give him the gospel, we try to help him shore up his education in some small way, we try to help him sort out his legal and debt problems, and we point him towards a job.</p>
<p>  But when we are done, he still lives in a dying city with low employment and poor churches. He’s still single, often supporting (or not supporting) children. He carries with him a criminal record and a lifetime of learned habits which do him little good. And he’s not getting any younger.</p>
<p>  That individual perspective must be remembered. It is true that the weakness of families in the African American community is a huge problem, but what good does it do to wag a finger in that man’s face and say, “You blacks need to be better husbands and fathers!”

<p>Psalm 28 is not complex poetry, though it is beautiful. David opens with a plea for mercy, asking Yahweh not to destroy him alongside the wicked. He spends some time describing the wicked men he has in mind&#8212;men who do evil, who are hypocrites toward their neighbors, who do not regard Yahweh&#8217;s works as they should. Then he praises Yahweh for answering that plea. It is not the propositional content in and of itself that gives the psalm its particular value; these ideas are found throughout the Psalms, as well as throughout Scripture. Rather, it is the particular way David put them together, and the particular response for which the psalm calls.</p>
<p>Poetry is designed not merely to communicate content but to move the heart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The fear of judgment is heavy in the first section. The second sequence paints a vivid picture of the men David has in mind. I described them above, but the poetry works far better on its own terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not drag me off with the wicked,<br />
  with the workers of evil,<br />
  who speak peace with their neighbors<br />
  while evil is in their hearts.<br />
  Give to them according to their work<br />
  and according to the evil of their deeds;<br />
  give to them according to the work of their hands;<br />
  render them their due reward.<br />
  Because they do not regard the works of the Lord<br />
  or the work of his hands,<br />
  he will tear them down and build them up no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David wants nothing to do with these kinds of people, and he wants very much not to be like them. He wants God to judge them, and he yearns not to be judged himself. So when he comes to the second half of the Psalm, we should <em>feel</em> the change. &#8220;Do not drag me off with the wicked&#8230; he will tear them down and build them up no more. / Blessed be Yahweh!&#8221; The sharp transition, the sudden turn from the fearful expectation of judgment toward praising Yahweh, should catch our attention and make us demand an answer.</p>
<p>David supplies us the answer, of course, in beautiful phrases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.<br />
  The <span style="font-variation: small-caps">Lord</span> is my strength and my shield;<br />
  in him my heart trusts, and I am helped;<br />
  my heart exults,<br />
  and with my song I give thanks to him.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-variation: small-caps">Lord</span> is the strength of his people;<br />
  he is the saving refuge of his anointed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plea David offered to begin has been answered. <em>Our</em> plea with David has been answered. Yahweh saves. But the response is not simply an acknowledgement of a fact: <em>This is true.</em> David&#8217;s response is exulting and singing. Exultation is elation and jubilation. This salvation warrants more than mere recitation of facts or even some degree of happiness. It deserves the kind of excited joy that comes bursting out of the heart in uncontainable song.</p>
<p>Yahweh saves. Hallelujah. Hallelujah!</p>

One of the reasons lots of evangelicals struggle with the Psalms: Americans are, by and large, no longer people are who read much poetry. For most evangelicals, the Psalms are it, in fact. Combine this with our already-strong tendency to treat the Scriptures as a source of propositions, and it&#8217;s no wonder we struggle to appreciate the Psalms as poetry.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Matthew waits until he is some 16 chapters into his text<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to start <em>explicitly</em> saying what the whole book has said implicitly thus far, and what the annunciation at the beginning proclaimed loud and clear: Jesus is the Messiah, the one to whom all the hopes and expectations engendered by the Old Testament pointed. &#8220;Who do you say that I am?&#8221; he asks. And Peter&#8217;s answer, ringing down through the ages, is still breath-taking in its assurance and simple truth: &#8220;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&#8221;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of the sermons I have heard on Matthew 16 focus on Peter&#8212;on his statement of the bedrock truth of our faith, or on his need of rebuke just a few verses later, or even on the question of Petrine authority over the church. Not many stop to notice how pivotal this chapter is in the flow of Matthew as a whole. Not many recognize that for the first time, Jesus openly accepts being called the Messiah, and openly proclaims what the Messiah will do&#8212;that is, <em>die</em>. Yes, Peter first got it amazingly, remarkably right and then got it equally amazingly, remarkably wrong. But at least as important here is the picture of who the Messiah is and what he is about.</p>
<p>Matthew spent 15 chapters getting here&#8212;laying the foundation in Jesus&#8217; teaching, his miraculous healings, and specific fulfillments of some prophecies and &#8220;filling up&#8221; of others<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&#8212;so that when Jesus acknowledges Peter&#8217;s claim, the reader is not only unsurprised, but delightedly saying, &#8220;Yes!&#8221; because Jesus&#8217; words and actions to this point confirm everything the prologue declared to be true of him. This is important, in no small part, because then Matthew turns around and hits the reader in the face with the unexpected: Jesus plans to be crucified.</p>
<p>Who <em>plans</em> that? Peter&#8217;s confusion is understandable (even if his response was ultimately so wrong that Jesus aligned Peter with Satan for trying to prevent it). No one plans to be crucified. But this Messiah does. Good thing we&#8217;re already convinced he&#8217;s the Messiah.</p>
<p>And then? Then Jesus tells us that whoever wants to follow him&#8212;whoever wants to &#8220;come after&#8221; him&#8212;needs to embrace that same cross. The call to follow this Messiah isn&#8217;t a call to immediate glory, and a kingdom of this world. It is a call to self-sacrifice, to lose the world and gain one&#8217;s soul. It is a call to live in such a way that when the Son of Man returns with his holy angels in judgment, we will not be ashamed.</p>
<p>As I closed yesterday: Lord come soon!&#8212;but in light of his coming, how shall we live? Come and die, he says. Come and die.</p>

Your Bible will say &#8220;Christ&#8221; almost certainly. It isn&#8217;t being used as the titular name here (&#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221;), though; this is Peter declaring his understanding that Jesus was the hoped-for Jewish Messiah.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

It is helpful, when reading through Matthew, to understand that the word our English Bibles translate as &#8220;fulfill&#8221; also has an ordinary, non-prophetic meaning of &#8220;fill up.&#8221; Following G. K. Beale, I actually think it should be translated this way in most of the cases where it appears in Matthew. Many of the otherwise challenging interpretive issues&#8212;what does it <em>mean</em> that he fulfilled thus-and-such a passage which isn&#8217;t talking about him?&#8212;become clear if you understand Matthew to be saying, &#8220;He filled this passage up with more meaning than was there before,&#8221; rather than &#8220;He fulfilled this prophecy that was referring to him [even though it wasn't].&#8221;&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

               <p><i class=editorial>I am writing up reflections on my devotions every day for six weeks. This is one of those posts.</i></p>
<p>Eschatology is a big word, but it&#8217;s an even bigger concept. The things to come &#8212;the things we do not yet see fully&#8212;are hard to grasp. Not so hard for us, perhaps, as they were for those who came before us. In Genesis 15, Abram<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> received a number of promises. None of them were exactly <em>easy</em> to believe: here he was, closing in on a century old, and his always-barren wife in the same category,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and God promises him a child from his own body. More than that, God promised him descendants that would outnumber the stars, or the sand on the seashore.</p>
<p>That promise has been fulfilled. In fact, it has been fulfilled doubly: first by the nation of Israel, in the course of her long history from Abraham to the time of Christ, and then through those many of us who have been grafted in since then. Just as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness (Genesis 15:6), so we have been counted righteous as we believe God, and now the number of those from the nations dwarfs even that of the Jews.</p>
<p>There is another promise there that wasn&#8217;t fulfilled, though&#8212;at least, not all the way. In verses 18&#8211;21, God promises Abram that his descendants will inherit a <em>massive</em> territory. Israel never did, though. The Hebrews&#8217; national territory, relatively substantial though it was at its peak, certainly never made it anywhere near the Euphrates on its eastern edge. Some might take this an example of the Bible&#8217;s fallibility. I don&#8217;t; I take it instead as a picture of things yet to come.</p>
<p>This kind of eschatological situation is common in the Bible. A promise is made, and the fulfillment comes, but only in part, never wholly. Even the Messianic promises, which we often think of as fulfilled in Christ, remain incomplete. They found their first and partial fulfillment in his first coming, just as the promises to Abraham were fulfilled first, partially, in the nation of Israel, and then again more fully in the nations (you and me, unless you&#8217;re a Jewish convert), and then finally someday when Jesus returns and the New Jerusalem is here on earth.</p>
<p>It is not a stretch to say that &#8220;eschatological hope&#8221;&#8212;mouthful though the phrase may be&#8212;is one of the defining characteristics of Christians. We are the people of &#8220;already but not yet&#8221; who are incomparably glad of what God has already done and impossibly hopeful about what he will someday do.</p>
<p>The nation of Israel got a taste of what the final fulfillment will be like as Jesus walked among them. Matthew 15 reiterates what Matthew 11 first made clear: Jesus is the one who fulfills the promises of God&#8217;s final setting things to rights&#8212;the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. But they did not see it <em>finished</em>. Jesus did not heal every person on the earth; we still have the mute and crippled and lame and blind among us, and all of us yet will die.</p>
<p>But there will come a day when he comes back, and those promises to Abraham are fulfilled in their entirety at last, and the hopes engendered by a prophet offering healing in the first century in Israel are realized. No more tears, no more sorrow, and we will worship our King and enjoy unbroken fellowship with God and one another in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Hallelujah. Lord, come soon.</p>

               <p>I continue to find Proverbs interesting, challenging, and insightful in ways I have not experienced in years. While I have made a habit of spending time in the book off and on since childhood (my parents encouraged me to read it regularly, not least for its advice on honoring and listening to one&#8217;s parents!), I have only begun to grasp how profoundly true its usually straightforward wisdom is as I have come back to it yet again in these last few weeks. God has seen fit to speak to almost any aspect of the mundane we could imagine or wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck,<br />
  will suddenly be broken beyond healing. (Proverbs 29:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with a number of verses I have come across in the last week, this one struck me in no small part because I now have had enough experience to see it for true experientially. Not personally, thanks be to God and to many faithful friends and family members who have born with me well. But I have watched others resist rebuke <em>ad nauseum</em>, and the result is never pleasant. Those who refuse to listen when others bring correction&#8212;who are absolutely unwilling to change&#8212;ultimately suffer for their stubborn folly. The choices we make are not without consequences; we can go on only so long before they catch up with us and <em>break</em> us. In light of this, we should learn to see God&#8217;s rebukes and his chastisements as measures of his grace. He does not rebuke us or bring chiding situations into our lives out of malice, but out of love, to save us from ourselves.</p>
<p>This has me doubly thoughtful: reminded, first of all, to be quick to accept rebuke in my own life, and then also to pray for those I know who are struggling in this area.</p>
<h2>Matthew 11</h2>
<p>It has been rather in vogue these last few years to suggest that what Jesus really cared about was the plight of the poor and downtrodden&#8212;what we might call issues of &#8220;social justice.&#8221; To be sure, Jesus <em>did</em> care about these things, and God has always cared about them. (There is hardly a book in the Bible where this concern is not displayed!) But as profound as God&#8217;s hatred of injustice and abuse of the helpless is, there is something he hates even more, unpopular as though is to say it: <em>unbelief</em>. In Matthew 11, Jesus rebukes three cities, Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Capernaum, not for any other sins but because there he had done a great many miracles, and they did not believe him. And refusing to believe in Christ deserved a harsher punishment than did all the myriad sins of Tyre and Sidon and Sodom: cities known for everything from economic injustice to rape and murder. We must therefore keep the gospel&#8217;s call to repent and believe Christ first and foremost&#8212;not neglecting the other matters of righteousness, but not forgetting that which is worst and has the highest penalty.</p>
